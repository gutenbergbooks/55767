<h2><span class="h2line1">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>Those readers who have penetrated far into
the Chinese Empire, as has the author, will be
quick to discover that he has substituted for the
name of the Thibetan Province one that will not
be recognized.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are evident. Ancestor
worship is still the prevailing creed of the most
numerous class of Chinese, and a violation of the
sanctity of any ancestral chih, or underground
tomb, would naturally be resented if it disgraced a
family so important as that of a royal prince of
the realm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The Chinese characters presented in the story
are drawn from life. Prince Kai Lun Pu is a
well-known type of the liberal-minded, educated
young men who are the best guarantee of the
future expansion of the Celestial Empire. The
rule of the Chief Eunuch still dominates every
palace in China, and even the efforts of the late
Dowager Empress could not restrain the encroaching
powers of these masterful creatures.</p>
<p>The manners and customs herein described
will serve to acquaint those who have not visited
China with some of the most curious traditions
of that ancient race, while the adventures related,
startling as they are, are fully within the
bounds of possibility.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SEA TRAGEDY.</span></h2>
<p>The sinking of the first-class passenger steamship
<i>Karamata Maru</i> in the neighborhood of
Hawaii on June 17, 1908, has been the subject
of so much newspaper comment that doubtless
the reader imagines he knows all the circumstances
connected with the fatal affair. But I
have carefully read these newspaper reports and
am astonished to find them quite perverted and
unreliable, the result of carelessness or ignorance
on the part of correspondents, the desire of officials
to shield themselves from blame and the
tendency of editors to amplify scant material into
three-column articles with numerous &ldquo;scare
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>I may well speak with authority in this connection,
because it was our ship, the <i>Seagull</i>,
which first arrived at the scene of the disaster
and rescued the passengers and crew of the ill-fated
<i>Karamata Maru</i> from their imminent peril
So I shall tell you the story in my own way, as
it has an important bearing on the extraordinary
events that afterward took place&mdash;events which
have led me to write this book, and place on
record a series of adventures so remarkable as to
have been seldom if ever equalled.</p>
<p>To begin with, I beg to introduce myself as
Sam Steele, of Chelsea, Massachusetts, eighteen,
years of age and filling the responsible position
of purser and assistant supercargo on the trim
little merchantman yacht, the <i>Seagull</i>. Indeed, I
am one of the three owners of our ship, the others
being my father, Captain Richard Steele, and my
uncle, Naboth Perkins. My father is a seasoned
and experienced seaman, who has sailed in nearly
every navigable part of the world. My uncle is
an expert trader and an honest man&mdash;a combination
that accounts for his great success in his
profession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Circumstances placed me on shipboard at an
early age, and in the course of several long and
eventful voyages I have encountered many adventures
and queer happenings that have made
me richer in experience than most young fellows.</p>
<p>One may remain modest and unassuming, I
think, and still bear witness to the truth of adventures
in which he has participated. It is not
because I love to speak of myself that I am telling
my own story, but because I have full knowledge
of those events in which I bore a personal
part, and so am qualified to relate them. And
you will discover, when I have finished the tale,
that I have not posed as a hero, but merely as a
subordinate actor in the drama&mdash;what, I believe,
is called a &ldquo;walking gentleman&rdquo; or &ldquo;general
utility man&rdquo; in theatrical parlance. The theatre
being, at its best, a reflection of real life, the
illustration is permissible.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to tell you something
about the company assembled aboard the <i>Seagull</i>
when she began her voyage from San Francisco
early in May to carry a cargo of mixed merchandise
to Canton, China.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The <i>Seagull</i> has no regular itinerary, but sails
a free lance in any sea and to any country where
it may be profitable for her to go. Both my
father and Uncle Naboth have adventurous natures,
and prefer to let fate direct their future
rather than attempt to plan a succession of tedious
and uninteresting voyages which might mean
surer gain but would afford less excitement.
This has resulted, however, in a neat fortune for
each of the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> three owners, and our success
has encouraged us to persist in our eccentric
methods. In the merchant service our beautiful
ship is dubbed a &ldquo;tramp,&rdquo; and I and my chums
are called &ldquo;the Boy Fortune Hunters,&rdquo; Uncle
Naboth &ldquo;the Yankee Trader&rdquo; and Captain Steele
&ldquo;crazy old Peg-leg,&rdquo;&mdash;because poor father has
really a wooden leg, which in no way, however,
renders him less able as a skipper. But we laugh
at this harmless raillery and, well knowing that
we are envied by many who thus banter us,
pursue our own way with unconcern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>So it happened that after a prosperous voyage
around the Horn, to deliver a valuable cargo of
tin-plate to the great canning factories of Oregon
and Washington, we had barely anchored in the
bay at San Francisco before we received a commission
to sail to Canton with a cargo of merchandise.
This suited us all; but none better than
me, for I had long desired to visit China, Japan
and the Philippines. Also it suited Joe Herring,
our cabin boy and my particular friend; and it
suited Archie Ackley, a well-to-do young fellow
who had sailed with us on a former voyage and
passed as my chum. Archie was a reckless, adventurous
sort of chap, and had made the trip
around the Horn on the <i>Seagull</i> to give a broken
leg time to knit perfectly, the said leg having
been damaged in a foolish wrestling bout.</p>
<p>I am sure you would shake your head dubiously
if I were to recount all of the characteristics of
this youth which had endeared him to our little
ship&rsquo;s company. I should be obliged to say, for
instance, that Archie was stubborn as a mule, conceited
as a peacock, reckless of all conventionalities,
and inclined to quarrel and fight on the
slightest provocation. But I should hasten to
add that he was brave as a lion and tender as a
woman to those he loved. His loyalty had been
fully proven on the occasion of that former voyage
to which I have referred, when he
accompanied us to Egypt and won our hearts
completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Archie was about my age; but Joe, our cabin
boy, was a little younger, and as staunch a friend
and queer a character in his way as you will
ever be able to find on this astonishing earth.</p>
<p>Joe is rich. He could purchase a mate to the
<i>Seagull</i> and never feel the expenditure. He could
sail on our craft, if he chose, as an honored guest;
but he prefers to remain a cabin-boy. Yet, in
truth, there is little caste among us, and if Joe
prefers to have duties to occupy him during a
voyage, and fulfils those duties admirably, no one
admires him less for that reason. Captain Steele
slaps him on the shoulder as fondly and familiarly
as he does Archie or me, and fat little Uncle
Naboth locks arms with Joe and promenades the
deck with him for hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>A slight, stooping lad, is Joe, with great dark
eyes, steady and true, and a faint smile always
curling his lips. His face is sensitive and expressive,
and in his slender frame lurk strength
and agility that are positively amazing when they
are called into action. Yet he is a silent fellow,
though by no means unsociable, and when he
speaks you are inclined to pay attention, for you
know that Joe has something to say. We three
boys were inseparable comrades at the time of
which I am writing, although perhaps Joe and I
were a little closer to each other than we were to
Archie.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s crew were staunch and able-bodied
seamen, carefully selected by my father, and our
engineers were picked men of proven ability.
But I must not forget to introduce to you two
important characters in the persons of our chef
and steward. The former was a South Sea
Islander named Bryonia, and the latter another
South Sea Islander named Nux. I say &ldquo;named&rdquo;
advisedly, for Uncle Naboth named them in this
queer way when he rescued the poor natives from
an open boat years ago and restored them to life
by liberal doses of nux and bryonia&mdash;the only
medicines that happened to be in his possession at
the time. They were, of course, unable to speak
English, at first; but they learned rapidly and
were devoted to Uncle Naboth, and afterward to
me. Indeed, I had come to regard both Nux and
Bry as my own personal followers, and well had
they proven their claim to this title. They were
nearly as dark as Africans, but very intelligent
and faithful in every emergency. In addition to
these qualities Bry was a capital cook, while as a
steward Nux was unsurpassed, and looked after
our comforts in a way so solicitous that he really
spoiled us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>We were about ten days out of the Golden Gate
and had left Honolulu well on our starboard
quarter, when one evening we ran into a dense
fog that could almost be felt. It set the deck
hands all coughing and wetted them to the skin;
so we all shut ourselves up aft in the cabin and
Captain Steele slowed the <i>Seagull</i> down to half
speed and kept the fog-horn blowing every half-minute.
We believed there was little danger in
this part of the broad Pacific, although every
sailor dreads a fog as he does a ghost and is
uneasy until it lifts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth and Archie played checkers on
one end of the cabin table while Joe and I had a
quiet game of cribbage together. Father smoked
his pipe and darned stockings under the light of
the swinging lamp, for Ned Britton, the first mate,
was in charge of the deck, and no better sailor
than Ned, or one more careful, ever was born.</p>
<p>So we passed the evening of the 16th of June
pleasantly enough, in spite of the drenching fog
outside, and when the watch changed all of us
save Captain Steele turned into our bunks and
fell asleep without minding the weird wail of the
fog-horn in the least. It is the kind of noise you
forget to listen to when you get used to it.</p>
<p>I was roused from my slumbers by the agitated
shuffling of feet on the deck overhead, the violent
ringing of the engine bells for the ship to go
astern and a medley of shouts and orders through
which my father&rsquo;s clarion voice could be distinctly
heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Before I was fully awake I found myself standing
on the floor and fumbling with my clothes,
instinct guiding me rather than knowledge of
what was impending. Danger there was, I realized,
and I noticed that my cabin was dimly
lighted, as though by the break of day. A moment
later I rushed on deck, to find all crowding
at the starboard bulwarks and peering out into
the mist.</p>
<p>Suddenly&mdash;scarce a boat&rsquo;s length away, it
seemed&mdash;there came a terrific crash and a grinding
of timbers, followed by shrieks and cries so
heartrending that I found myself shuddering with
horror. Yet not a man of us moved. We stood
as if turned to stone. For it was not the <i>Seagull</i>
that had struck; but behind the impenetrable curtain
of the fog a tragedy of the sea was being enacted
that was terrible enough to curdle the blood
in our veins; for we realized that Death was claiming
his victims from the men and women of some
unknown vessel.</p>
<p>Then, by one of those marvelous transformations
wrought by Nature, the fog instantly lifted
and dissipated, and there before us was a sight
that wrung moans, curses or shouts from our very
hearts, so awful was it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>A big liner&mdash;the <i>Karamata Maru</i>, we afterward
learned&mdash;had driven her bow straight into the
broad side of a great freighter, a derelict known
as the <i>Admiral Swain</i>, which had been abandoned
in a storm a month earlier.</p>
<p>The <i>Karamata Maru</i> had crushed through the
sides of the derelict and then her bow had lifted
and slid high and dry across it, plunging the stern
of the liner deep into the sea. In this terrible
position the great liner trembled a moment and
then broke in two. Her steel plates buckled and
crumbled like tin, and the crash that followed as
she splintered and tore asunder was greater than
that when she struck. Again we heard the
screams and terrified cries of the poor victims and
as the sea rushed madly into the gaping compartments
and the escaping steam hissed from the
open seams, scores of men and women threw
themselves into the water in an effort to escape
what seemed a more horrible fate than drowning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>We saw and heard all this, for the <i>Seagull</i> had
lost headway and floated gently a short distance
from the scene of the tragedy. But the next
moment we awoke to action. Every life preserver
and rope&rsquo;s end we could muster flew overboard
and our boats were manned and lowered in a
twinkling. Big Ned Britton, the mate, was the
first to put off in the cutter, and was picking the
struggling forms from the sea long before the
whaler was on the scene and assisting in the work
of rescue. I took the gig myself and at once
found my task so arduous that I had little time
to mark what the other boats were doing. I only
know that we all accomplished wonders, and every
man, woman and child that managed to float until
we reached them was rescued. Fortunately the
sea was calm, and the light breeze that had dissipated
the fog merely rippled the waves.</p>
<p>At last, as I looked around for more survivors,
someone hailed me from the wreck of the <i>Karamata
Maru</i> and I bade my men row swiftly to her
side. Already the great liner rode so low that the
little group awaiting me was almost on a level
with my head, and I realized that I was in a dangerous
position in case she sank. The freighter
also was filling rapidly.</p>
<p>First those on the <i>Karamata Maru</i> lowered an
injured man into the gig, and two attendants&mdash;one
the ship&rsquo;s doctor, I afterward learned&mdash;came
with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, gentlemen,&rdquo; I called to the others; but
they shook their heads and retreated from the
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, sir,&rdquo; growled the doctor. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
ship&rsquo;s officers and won&rsquo;t leave their charge. Cast
off, for God&rsquo;s sake, or we&rsquo;ll follow her to the
bottom when she sinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, seized with a sudden panic at the
warning words, and my men rowed lustily from
the dangerous neighborhood of the wreck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>We reached the side of the <i>Seagull</i> just as Ned
had assisted the last of his rescued passengers up
the ladder, and I made haste to get my own
aboard. The injured man had fainted. I noticed
that he was a Chinaman, although dressed in
European costume, and that he was an object of
great solicitude on the part of his attendant and
the doctor. We put him in a sling and hoisted
him up the side, and after the others had followed
and I was preparing to mount the ladder myself a
mighty shout from our deck arrested my attention.
I turned quickly, just in time to see the
awful climax to this disaster. The derelict and
the liner sank together, and the sea gave a great
gasp and closed over them, whirling and seething
about the spot as if a thousand sea-monsters were
disporting themselves there. The suction was so
great that had we not already caught the davit
falls the gig would have assuredly been drawn
into the whirlpool, while the ship to which I clung
trembled in every beam, as if with horror at the
sight she had witnessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PRINCE KAI LUN PU.</span></h2>
<p>When I gained the deck of the <i>Seagull</i> an
affecting sight met my eyes. It was crowded
thick with despairing and agitated men and
women, for all had lost their possessions and many
their friends and relatives within the preceding
half hour. Bry had brewed huge pots of coffee,
for the morning air was still chilly and the rescued
ones had nearly all been pulled from the water;
so, our hearts full of pity for the poor wretches,
we tried to comfort and cheer them as well as lay
within our power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The collision happened at twenty minutes after
five in the morning; by six o&rsquo;clock all the rescued
were on the deck of the <i>Seagull</i>. We found we
picked up two hundred and eighteen out of the
three hundred and twenty-seven who had constituted
the passengers and crew of the ill-fated
<i>Karamata Maru</i>. One hundred and nine, including
the Japanese officers, who deliberately went
down with their ship, had perished.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock before the steamship <i>Nagasaki
Maru</i> hove in sight, and eleven when she
came alongside us. I make this positive statement
despite the inaccurate newspaper reports to the
effect that the <i>Nagasaki Maru</i> was at the scene
of the collision and assisted the <i>Seagull</i> to rescue
the survivors.</p>
<p>Of course the <i>Nagasaki Maru</i>, belonging to the
same line as the lost <i>Karamata Maru</i>, promptly
transferred all the rescued ones to her own decks;
and that was just as well, because our ship was too
small to carry them all in comfort, and we were
really under no obligations to do more than we
had already done. The <i>Karamata Maru</i> had been
bound for Japan, so the <i>Nagasaki Maru</i>, being
on her way to San Francisco, undertook to leave
the passengers and crew of her sister ship at
Honolulu until they could be picked up by some
other west-bound ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>As they steamed away from us the poor survivors
who swarmed upon her decks saluted us
with a hearty cheer of gratitude for our services,
and this appreciation fully repaid us.</p>
<p>As I stood leaning over the rail and watching
the fast receding <i>Nagasaki Maru</i>, Joe touched
my elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch is ready, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I remembered that I had eaten nothing
except a cup of Bryonia&rsquo;s coffee since early morning,
and I quickly went below. Already we had
steamed away upon our course and the midday
sun was shining brightly overhead.</p>
<p>I found all our ship&rsquo;s officers assembled in the
saloon except the second mate, old Eli Trent,
who had the deck watch, and during the meal we
naturally discoursed at length upon the exciting
events of the morning.</p>
<p>I had nearly finished luncheon when our
steward, Nux, whispered over my shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinaman wants to see you, Marse Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Chinaman, Nux?&rdquo; I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt man, Marse Sam. He in front stateroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked inquiringly at my father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve took a passenger, Sam,&rdquo; said the Captain,
calmly buttering his toast. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Chink&rsquo;
you took off&rsquo;n the wreck is a high mandarin, a
prince, or suthin&rsquo;, and wanted to get home to
China as soon as possible, fer he&rsquo;s hurt bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t usually accept passengers,&rdquo; I remarked
thoughtfully, &ldquo;but if this poor fellow is
injured and homesick, it&rsquo;s our duty to do what we
can for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; added a gruff voice
behind me, and the ship&rsquo;s doctor from the <i>Karamata
Maru</i> dropped into a seat at the table and
began to eat. We watched him a moment in
silence. Then I asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your patient very bad, Doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaylord; my name&rsquo;s Gaylord. I&rsquo;m an Englishman,
although I sailed on that blasted Jap
ship. And my patient, Prince Kai, is dying.
He&rsquo;ll never see China again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I exclaimed, really distressed, and the
others echoed my sympathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;He got jammed between the timbers,&rdquo; explained
Dr. Gaylord, as he continued his luncheon,
&ldquo;and although three of his attendants threw themselves
around him and met their own death in
trying to shield him, the Prince was badly
smashed and can&rsquo;t possibly live more than a day or
two. It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; he added, shaking his grizzled
head, &ldquo;for Kai Lun Pu has just been made one
of the five Viceroys of the Empire, and he&rsquo;s a fine
young fellow who had a promising future. The
redemption of China, gentlemen, must come
through these young scions of the nobility who are
being educated at the colleges of England and
America. They&rsquo;ll imbibe modern, progressive
ideas, and in time upset the old prejudices of the
Flowery Kingdom altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and cast at me a scrutinizing gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the young man who brought us off
the wreck, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince has asked for you twice. Perhaps
you&rsquo;d better go to him now. I&rsquo;ve given him
a hypodermic and he feels easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he wish to see me?&rdquo; I asked
curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some fool notion of gratitude, I suppose.
These educated Chinese are very courteous and
punctilious fellows. It&rsquo;s likely he wouldn&rsquo;t die
comfortably if he had neglected to thank you for
your slight services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go in alone?&rdquo; I asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; walk right in. The Death&rsquo;s-Head is with
him,&rdquo; added the doctor with a snort of contempt
that I did not understand.</p>
<p>So I softly turned the handle of the stateroom
door and walked in. It was not a pleasant errand
to visit a dying man, and I wanted to get it over
with as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The state cabin of the <i>Seagull</i> was a roomy&mdash;almost
spacious&mdash;apartment, and we had fitted it
up carefully for the use of any important guest
we might have aboard. It had never been used
but once before, and as I glanced around it I felt
a pang that it was now to be the scene of a death,
and that a miserable Chinaman should put this
blemish upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Seated upon a stool beside the curtained bunk
was the Chinese attendant I had brought aboard
with the Prince and the doctor. Immediately
I understood Dr. Gaylord&rsquo;s expression, &ldquo;the
Death&rsquo;s-Head,&rdquo; for this Chinaman typified that
mythical horror in feature and expression. Perhaps
I should say lack of expression, for his face
was as immobile as Death itself, of a pallid gray-green
color, and the skin was drawn tight as
parchment over his high cheek-bones and across
his thin lips. The eyes were dark and bright, but
conveyed no more animation or intelligence than
would glass eyes. He was dressed rather primly
in a suit of black broadcloth, cut in London
fashion.</p>
<p>As I entered, this attendant rose like an automaton
and drew the curtains of the bunk, muttering
a brief sentence in Chinese.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SMILING AT DEATH.</span></h2>
<p>I advanced with a respectful bow and found
myself looking squarely into the eyes of the injured
man. Then I gave a start of surprise, for
a young man&mdash;almost a boy, he seemed&mdash;was
smiling at me from the pillows as cheerily as if
greeting an old friend who had come to take part
in a jubilation.</p>
<p>In my recollections of him I have never thought
of Prince Kai Lun Pu as a Chinaman. His features
bore certain characteristics of his race,
assuredly; but he was so thoroughly Europeanized,
so cultured, frank and agreeable in demeanor,
that no one could possibly think of him
otherwise than as a royal good fellow whom it was
a privilege to know. With his poor maimed body
covered by the counterpane, the pleasant&mdash;almost
merry&mdash;expression of his boyish face made one
doubt that he had been injured at all, and I
thought he looked as little like a dying man as
anyone could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are young Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said he in perfect
English, &ldquo;and I am well pleased to see you, sir;
for you have rendered me a rare service and have
earned my lasting gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a simple duty,&rdquo; I responded, with an
answering smile; &ldquo;but I am glad I was able to
serve so important a personage, Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important?&rdquo; said he, arching his eyebrows;
&ldquo;ah, perhaps you might find me so, were we together
in my own province of Kwang-Kai-Nong.&rdquo;
A shadow passed over his face, and he
sighed; but next moment, with renewed cheerfulness,
he added, &ldquo;but we are not in China, Mr.
Steele, and aboard your noble ship the humble
passenger must defer to your own more powerful
individuality.&rdquo; He cast an amused glance at the
Death&rsquo;s-Head and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defer, Mai Lo, to the noble American; defer
for us both, since I am helpless!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The attendant, outwardly unmoved and unresponsive,
prostrated himself before me, and then
resumed his former position. I could not resist a
light laugh at the ridiculousness of the performance,
and the Prince joined in the merriment.
Then, suddenly recollecting myself, I became
grave and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you suffering, Prince? Do you think
you are badly hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright eyes regarded me intently for an
instant, after which he turned to the Death&rsquo;s-Head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me, Mai Lo; I would converse with
my host,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The attendant again prostrated himself, this
time to his Prince, and retired without a word
of protest. But almost immediately the Doctor
came hurrying in, and there was protest in both
his words and demeanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, Prince Kai,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is no
time for reckless folly. I gave you morphine to
quiet your pain and enable you to sleep, and you
positively must not excite yourself and neutralize
the effect of the medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man gave him a look half whimsical,
half sympathetic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Gaylord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have, in
your wisdom, numbered the hours remaining to
me, and I accept the decree as final. But why
should I sleep during those brief hours, when rest
eternal will soon be mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor flushed and cast down his eyes.
He was a good-hearted man, and not yet calloused
in the presence of death. The Prince
smiled upon him in kindly fashion and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an ample supply of morphine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is ample, my Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen to my wish. I do not care to
sleep, nor do I want to suffer in the brief time
you have allotted me. Let me secure all the
pleasure I am able to until the Earth Dragon
completes his vengeance upon me. That will be
kind, dear Doctor, and your reward shall be provided
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old surgeon took the Chinaman&rsquo;s hand and
pressed it warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the reward, my Prince,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of a job just now, and am glad to
experiment upon you, so I shan&rsquo;t get rusty. Your
wish shall be respected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave me with Mr. Steele awhile,&rdquo; was
the reply, &ldquo;and see that Mai Lo doesn&rsquo;t disturb
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor bowed with deference and withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they call me Sam aboard
this ship, and I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you do the
same. I&rsquo;m not much used to a handle to my
name, and if we&rsquo;re to be friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to be friends, Sam,&rdquo; he rejoined,
quickly; &ldquo;so just squat upon that stool and let us
have a good chat together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was really charmed with my new acquaintance,
he was so animated, so frank in admitting
me to his friendship and so evidently grateful to
me for the slight service I had rendered him.
His brightness made me forget the pitiful fact
that he had but a short time to live, until he
himself reminded me of it.</p>
<p>I can imagine no more delightful a companion
than Prince Kai Lun Pu must have been before
his terrible accident. He began by telling me
much of his history, in a whimsical, half facetious
way that deprived the relation of any affectation
or egotism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>A prince of the royal blood and related to the
reigning Manchu family, Kai had been early
singled out for an important position in the empire
and sent to England to be educated. He
had graduated from Oxford a year before, and
after a brief visit to his own country, where he
held a long consultation with the Emperor and
that terrible old woman, Tsi An, the Dowager
Empress, he had toured Europe, Egypt and India,
and afterward visited the principal cities of
the United States. This had enabled him to
study other nations and to note their manners
and customs, and he was returning to China as a
Viceroy and a member of the Imperial Cabinet,
to which post he had already been appointed,
when he met with the terrible accident which
was to cut short his brilliant career.</p>
<p>So much this royal prince confided to me in
our first interview; but he cared less to talk of
himself than to be amused, and soon he began to
question me as to my own history and adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Being willing to amuse the poor fellow, and
having no duties that required my attention, I
passed the afternoon in relating the adventures of
my brief life. These seemed to astonish him
greatly, and he questioned me closely in regard
to Alaska and Panama, where I had voyaged with
my father and Uncle Naboth, but which he had
never visited. I also told him some queer adventures
of mine in Egypt, but he was more
familiar with that country.</p>
<p>I feared to weary the young Prince with my
long stories, but he would not let me go. Twice
during the afternoon Dr. Gaylord came in and
administered to his patient hypodermic injections
of morphine, and these must have kept him free
from pain, for he made no complaints and retained
his bright cheerfulness until I finally
insisted on leaving him.</p>
<p>Outside his door was the unemotional Mai Lo,
standing as stiffly as a statue. The attendant
saluted me with great respect and immediately
entered his master&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaylord was in the saloon smoking a
cigar, and he nodded as I approached and said;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer fellow, Prince Kai, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very charming fellow, I think, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and richer than Rothschild&mdash;or your
Rockefeller,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You should have seen
him arrayed in his native costume on board the
<i>Karamata Maru</i>, and surrounded by his four devoted
followers. He was a picture, I assure you,
and dignified and gracious enough to warrant his
royal blood. Everyone liked him, heathen
though he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathen!&rdquo; I echoed, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s a heathen. But I admit he
makes you forget that, for in London and at
Oxford he acquired the polish of an English
gentleman. It was only when I noted the rascals
surrounding him that I realized he was a
Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were faithful,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the death,&rdquo; said he, with a slight shudder.
&ldquo;They even tried to oppose their frail bodies between
him and the ship&rsquo;s splintering timbers.
Sir, it would have made you cringe to see their
mangled remains&mdash;&mdash;as I did. But the sacrifice
did no good at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure he will die?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am positive. Surgical skill can do nothing
to save him. If only old Death&rsquo;s-Head had perished
with him,&rdquo; he added, with a glance toward
the state cabin, &ldquo;I should feel more reconciled.
But Mai Lo happened to be in a safe place, and
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he old?&rdquo; I asked musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell a Chinaman&rsquo;s age from
his looks,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Yet I would wager
that Mai Lo is sixty, if he&rsquo;s a day. I&rsquo;m told that
at home he&rsquo;s the governor of Prince Kai&rsquo;s native
province, and a person of consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; said I, frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one likes him, not even his young master,&rdquo;
returned the Doctor. &ldquo;By the way, how
old should you judge Kai Lun Pu to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Prince is eighteen&mdash;or nineteen,&rdquo;
I hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is seven-and-twenty. These Chinese seem
to age very slowly, unless they&rsquo;re addicted to
opium, like the coolies. Have a cigar, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>I shook my head and went on deck, where
Archie and Joe at once collared me with a demand
to know what &ldquo;His Royal Muchness, the
Chink&rdquo; had been talking about all the afternoon.
I was quite full of the subject and told them as
much as I knew about our injured passenger,
adding that I was sincerely sorry the poor fellow
must die.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A STARTLING PROPOSITION.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning after breakfast I was again summoned
to attend Prince Kai Lun Pu. I may as
well remark in this place that with the Chinese
the surname comes first, and Kai was my new
friend&rsquo;s family name, as mine is Steele. &ldquo;Pu&rdquo;
with him stood in the place of &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; with me,
and Lun was his middle name. But as the
Chinese name always means something, a free
translation of Kai Lun Pu into English would be
&ldquo;blossom of the tree,&rdquo; Kai being a tree, or in
some connections the root of a tree. So the
Prince&rsquo;s name was a very pretty and appropriate
one, although it sounds so queer to our uncomprehending
ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>My new friend greeted me as cheerily as on
the previous day, although I noted the fact that
dark circles had settled around his eyes and his
cheeks were a bit more hollow. The doctor was
with him when I came in, and I asked if his
patient had slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a wink,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Our Prince does
not intend to lose a moment of life, and so I sat
up with him until after midnight myself. Then
he talked to Mai Lo until daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was time wasted,&rdquo; added the
Prince, with a queer glance at his attendant, &ldquo;for
Mai Lo has a limited vocabulary, although he is
so wise and experienced. I think he spoke six
words to me in return for all my chatter. So
now I will excuse him from my presence until I
require his services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo heard and prostrated himself humbly
before his Prince, retiring with the stealthy glide
of a ghost. The doctor was preparing his hypodermic
syringe, and the sick man watched him
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see much change in my condition?&rdquo;
he presently asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered the doctor. &ldquo;Your vitality
is wonderful. An ordinary man would have
succumbed long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I sure of today?&rdquo; enquired the Prince.</p>
<p>The surgeon administered the hypodermic before
replying. Then he said, slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While your heart retains its action you will
live; but a clot may interfere with the action at
any time. I cannot promise you even today, yet
you may see the light tomorrow&mdash;or of several
tomorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not many of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many, Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the Earth Dragon is relentless. I cannot
reach China?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. To Shanghai or Hong Kong is
two weeks. And there is another thing that I
must speak to you about. I have no means of
embalming or preserving your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the Prince looked grave. Then
he laughed again, lightly, but I thought with
little or no mirth. In spite of his Occidental education
Kai Lun Pu retained the prejudices of his
forefathers and longed to have his body carried
to China and laid to rest in his ancestral halls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a fuss old Mai Lo will make when I
am cast into the sea!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to put him in irons, Sam, or he&rsquo;ll run amuck
among you and cause mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does he shall go after you,&rdquo; I promised.
&ldquo;That is, unless you wish him preserved to carry
out your bequests at home and convey your
messages to your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince made a face so ridiculous that both
Gaylord and I smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will confide to you a secret,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my
servant is fully as repulsive to me as he is to
you. But he is a man of high birth, a mandarin
and the hereditary governor of my own province;
so I had to carry the fellow with me on my
travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a dummy,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his looks are very deceptive,&rdquo; retorted
the Prince. &ldquo;Mai Lo is remarkably subtle and
observing, and as intelligent as he is proud and
ambitious. Really, until my accident occurred, I
feared the fellow, although I knew he would sacrifice
his life for me if necessary. It will be his
duty after my death to return to his home, propitiate
the Earth Dragon, and then commit suicide;
but the chances are Mai Lo will find a way
to avoid that. There will be too much to feed his
ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will he inherit your estates?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means. Mai Lo is noble, but not of
the blood royal. My estates will go to the Emperor,
because I have no heir; my ancestral halls
will be sealed up and abandoned, and&mdash;I shall
soon be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I shall never become an ancestor
myself,&rdquo; he responded, laughing genuinely this
time. &ldquo;An absurd statement, isn&rsquo;t it, Sam? But
my countrymen are devoted Shintoists, or ancestor
worshippers, and while I have gained honor
and respect in life through my powerful ancestry,
in death I lose all and am speedily forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I thoughtfully pondered this statement
the doctor withdrew and left us alone together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in this queer religion of ancestor
worship, Prince?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Sam. I&rsquo;m a mighty poor
Chinaman, as far as our orthodox traditions and
religious observances are concerned. In fact my
people are not really religious at all, for they
vilify and even thrash their bronze and wooden
gods if they do not behave properly, and the
whole ceremonial worship of China is a farce.
I do not mind telling you that even before I went
to Europe my heart refused to acknowledge those
decayed ancestors of mine as more important
than the dust to which they have returned in the
course of nature. But I kept the secret of my
apostacy to myself, and in order to secure ample
funds to enjoy the pleasures of Europe I even
robbed my ancestral halls of a portion of their
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is there treasure, then, in
your ancestral halls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than half the wealth of China&mdash;the accumulated
wealth of centuries&mdash;is tied up forever
in this absurd manner,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My family
was old at the time of the Tartar invasion, and
it has always been wealthy. In my ancestral
halls, in my province of Kwang-Kai-Nong, lies a
mass of treasure that would startle the world if
it were to be unearthed and publicly displayed.
Yet no one has ever seen it in my generation but
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not quite understand this system,&rdquo; I
said, much interested in these statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our immemorial custom,&rdquo; explained the
Prince, &ldquo;to bury with each head of a family one-half
the wealth he possesses, to be used by him
when his resurrection occurs at the end of the
world. The remaining half is inherited by his
eldest son, his successor. A daughter never inherits,
you know. When the son dies, one-half
his wealth is laid with his body in the tombs of
the ancestral halls, and so this accumulation goes
on from century to century, and half the wealth
of the nation is continually abstracted from its
resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose there is no son,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What
happens then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the line ends. In the case of a noble
family, such as ours, the confidential servant secretly
seals up the ancestral halls and then commits
suicide, so that no one may ever discover
where they are located. If he hesitates to kill
himself by the ninth day the other servants
promptly kill him; so his fate is really sealed in
case his lord dies without an heir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;And is Mai Lo your confidential servant in
this case?&rdquo; I asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have guessed it,&rdquo; replied the Prince,
smiling. &ldquo;If I were sure he would do his duty it
would deprive death of half its sting; but I suspect,
Sam, that Mai Lo has as little respect for
ancestor worship as I myself, and it is my impression
that he will rob the tombs of my forefathers
very freely before he seals them up forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t his fellow-servants kill him if he
fails to commit suicide?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could answer that question more positively
if I knew the mind of Mai Lo better,&rdquo; returned
the Prince, more gravely than was his wont.
Then he brightened and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much interested in your friends Archie
and Joe, who were so loyal and brave in your
Egyptian adventures, which you related to me
yesterday. Did you not say they were still your
comrades?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Prince. Both are now aboard
the <i>Seagull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I see them? Will you bring them here
to see me?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be greatly pleased,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once. You remember the doctor&rsquo;s
warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them,&rdquo; said I, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Mai Lo,&rdquo; suggested the Prince. I did
so, asking the attendant, who stood stiffly outside
the door, to summon my friends to an
audience with Kai Lun Pu.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Joe and Archie arrived, as
eager as I knew they would be to make the
acquaintance of our interesting passenger.</p>
<p>The Prince conversed with them upon various
subjects for fully an hour, pressing them for details
of our former adventures and shrewdly
drawing out the characteristics of both the boys
without their suspecting it in the least. I felt
quite proud of my friends, for although
each in his own way was odd to the verge of
eccentricity, two more manly, truer hearted fellows
did not exist&mdash;or at least that was my
opinion of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The Prince seemed to approve of them, too,
and with their quaint answers and ways they certainly
amused him&mdash;Archie bluff and outspoken
and Joe modest and retiring as a girl.</p>
<p>Presently, as he lay back upon his pillows, Kai
Lun Pu began to laugh. He laughed again,
seemingly much amused; and still again, with
evident enjoyment of some thought that had occurred
to him. Archie and Joe stared at him
rather uneasily, and I own I had myself a fleeting
suspicion that his maimed body was finally
affecting his mind. But the next moment the
Prince said, in his ordinary tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the big and little gods, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what, Prince?&rdquo; I asked, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you a new adventure to undertake,&rdquo; he
replied, almost gleefully. &ldquo;You three boys are
not tired of adventures, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; returned Archie, stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And although you&rsquo;ve found some small treasure
already, you wouldn&rsquo;t object to finding more,
would you?&rdquo; he continued, eyeing us closely.</p>
<p>Our eager faces must have answered him; but
I said, as calmly as I could:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the proposition, your Highness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposition is simply this, Sam; I&rsquo;m
going to show you how to rob my ancestral
halls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE HALLS OF HIS ANCESTORS.</span></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid we looked rather foolish at this
suggestion. Archie was open-mouthed and wide-eyed;
Joe&rsquo;s sensitive face took on a frown, and
I felt myself flushing red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Prince,&rdquo; I said at last, shifting uneasily
in my seat, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been adventurers, but
not buccaneers, and to <i>rob</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Kai, laughing at us again;
&ldquo;the word &lsquo;rob&rsquo; does not mean to steal, even in
your bungling English. And I used it figuratively.
To rob my ancestral halls would not be
a sin, for you would deprive no living person of
what is his at present or might be his in the
future. As for the dead, my opinion is that my
ancestors are very dead; and, in case their bodies
resurrect at the end of the world, they won&rsquo;t
mind whether they are wealthy or not. I tell
you, Sam, I can imagine no more foolish idea
than to bury treasure with the dead, and had I
lived to return to China it was my firm intention
to rob the ancestral halls myself. In that case no
one would ever know it, and there would be no
danger. Why, as I said before, I abstracted certain
jewels from the tombs years ago, and spent
the proceeds in high living. So, if I was willing
to rob the ancestral halls myself, and approve of
your robbing them in my place, now that I am
prevented, you need have no scruples on the plea
of morality. Listen, friends: I present to you
three&mdash;to Sam and Joe and Archie&mdash;all of the
treasure contained in my ancestral halls. It is
yours&mdash;I give it freely&mdash;but you must go and
secure it, and that will be a dangerous expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you won&rsquo;t have me to assist you,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Because you must oppose the ancestral
devotion, amounting to a religion, of the
entire Chinese nation. Because my own followers
and servants would cut you down in an
instant if your errand were discovered, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any more interesting reasons?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strongest of all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Because I
am convinced that Mai Lo means to get the
treasure himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe gave a low whistle, and Archie looked
especially thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it worth while, then, for us to undertake
the adventure?&rdquo; I questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For centuries past one-half of the wealth of
one of the richest families in China has been
placed in the vaults which I call my ancestral
halls,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;This wealth consists of
jade, precious stones&mdash;especially rubies&mdash;pearls
and stores of gold and silver. There is enough
to ransom a kingdom, and as I cannot use it
myself I should like you to get it&mdash;if you can.
Your task would be difficult in any event, for to
rob any ancestral hall is a great crime in China.
Even the graves of the poor, which are stone or
mud vaults with roofs of bamboo and palm
leaves, are respected by all. Yet your greatest
danger is from Mai Lo. If he cannot rob my
ancestral halls himself he will try to prevent
anyone else from doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Archie; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s toss him overboard,
while we have the chance. He&rsquo;s only a
Chinaman.&rdquo; The next instant, seeing the amused
smile on the Prince&rsquo;s face, he realized what he
had said and began to apologize. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard,
sir,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to think of you except as one of
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the naive compliment pleased the
Prince, for he laughed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a <i>wise</i> thing to cast Mai Lo into
the sea. But I do not think you will undertake
murder, even to secure my treasure. So I will
do what I can to enable you to outwit the mandarin.
Can you find me a piece of paper and a
small brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe got them from his cabin in a few moments,
and while he was absent we all sat in silence.</p>
<p>I spread the piece of paper upon the coverlet in
front of the Prince, and dipped the brush in ink
for him. His left arm was broken and useless,
but fortunately he could use his right arm and
hand, though with difficulty. At once he began
writing in Chinese characters upon the paper,
and presently he finished and held out the brush
for me to take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot read my signature, Sam,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;but it is there, and will be recognized. It is
an order to all my dependents to recognize you
and your companions as my guests for one year,
and to serve you as faithfully as they would myself.
I have added that my spirit will watch to
see if I am obeyed and to take vengeance if I am
not. That is, of course, nonsense to us; but it
ought to be effective with my people. Take the
paper, Sam, and guard it carefully. Stay! call
in Mai Lo for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so, and the Prince said to his attendant
in an easy tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witness this order, Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandarin glanced at the document, but
though I watched him carefully I could detect
no sign of emotion in his glassy eyes, or even
surprise or interest upon his putty-like features.
He took the brush from my hand and obediently
added his signature to that of the Prince. Then,
at his master&rsquo;s command, he again retired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>I took the paper, folded it carefully, and placed
it in my wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are decided to undertake the adventure?&rdquo;
asked the Prince, in a pleased voice.</p>
<p>I looked at Archie and Joe, and they both
nodded. So I answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will seek for the treasure, your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now take the signet ring
from my finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed. It was a heavy gold band, curiously
engraved and set with a huge ruby. The stone
had an upper flat surface, on which were cut
three strange characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not display this ring except in case of
necessity,&rdquo; warned Kai Lun Pu. &ldquo;When you do,
it will command obedience of every man in my
province. It will even be powerful with the
Emperor. So keep it safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked him and stowed the ring in my
pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;there is but one
more thing I can do for you, but that ought to
prove of great assistance in your venture.
Listen carefully, all of you, for the secret I am
about to confide to your ears may not be written
down in any way, and the memory alone must
guard it. Heretofore it has been handed down
in my family from generation to generation by
confiding the knowledge to the eldest son, who
alone inherits. My ancestors would have died
sooner than allow a stranger or an alien to know
this family secret; but I&mdash;I am different. In me
the shackles of tradition and foolish custom have
been broken by a liberal education and a knowledge
of the great world whose existence many of
my countrymen do not even suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, as if in thought, and
then continued as follows, speaking slowly and
distinctly but in a lowered voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easy for you to locate the ancestral
halls of the family of Kai. It is near to my own
palace, and you will first see a quaint but beautiful
house of polished bamboo, with an entrance
on each of its four sides. Each entrance is
guarded by a god, and it will be wise for you to
pretend to propitiate these gods by offerings.
Burn prayers for my spirit&rsquo;s welfare before them.
You must not enter this house, for it is sacred;
but I will describe it to you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the center is a stone walled pit, with steps
leading downward. In the center of the pit is
a bronze tablet, which, when lifted, discloses a
passageway. This passage forms a long tunnel
slanting into the earth, and if you could follow
it, it would lead you to the underground vault,
or chih, where my noble ancestors lie buried.
This vault is cut from the solid rock, and is a
big domed chamber ornamented with the best art
of the ages that have elapsed since its construction.
The tapestries are said to be the best and
most valuable in the whole Empire. Around the
sides of this chamber are the niches where repose
the burial caskets of my respected ancestors, and
beside each casket are placed the chests, urns and
taborets containing one-half the wealth this ancestor
died possessed of. Do you understand this
description?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can picture it perfectly,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is well. But now for the secret.&rdquo;
Again he lowered his voice, with an uneasy glance
toward the door, behind which he knew Mai Lo
was stationed. Then he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a second, or secret, entrance to the
burial chamber, which no one outside of the
heir of our house has ever suspected. It was
built seven centuries ago by Kai Tai, a pious
man who wished to worship in secret at the
tombs of his ancestors without the formal ceremony
required when entering the ancestral hall
publicly. This private entrance is also a tunnel,
and leads from my palace itself. Now, my
friends, pay strict attention. There is, in the
palace, a set of rooms called the Suite of the
Horned Fish, from its mode of decoration. These
are the apartments always occupied by the royal
prince of our line, and so they will be vacant
when you arrive at the palace. The main doorway
to the Suite of the Horned Fish will doubtless
be guarded night and day, and it will not be
wise for you to try to force an entrance therein.
But in the bend of the passageway just beyond
the entrance is a tapestry representing the Earth
Dragon embracing a woman, and behind this
tapestry you will find a small ball or knob of
bronze. Pull this ball toward you, outward, and
a private door will open leading directly into my
sleeping chamber. Once there, you are not liable
to interruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;In one corner of this chamber is a great statue
of the first Kai in armor. It is a dreadful thing,
and used to frighten me when a boy; but in its
carving the statue shows great artistic skill. By
pushing the left foot sideways&mdash;it will require a
strong pressure&mdash;a panel in the wall back of the
statue will be released. It is the entrance to the
secret passage and once you have found it the
rest is easy. It leads to one of the niches in the
vault of my ancestors, the tapestries cleverly concealing
the doorway. By means of this passage
you may convey all or a part of the treasure to
my chamber in the palace, and from there I
must leave you to your own ingenious devices to
transport it safely to Shanghai or aboard your
ship. Have I made this quite plain to you, my
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite plain,&rdquo; we all answered, pleased to have
the adventure so easily arranged for us; and I
added:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;How can we thank you, Prince Kai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am well repaid in believing you will outwit
old Mai Lo, and secure the treasure he means to
steal,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;If I possess spirit I
shall try to watch you and enjoy the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; exclaimed Archie with a
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t know it, and I haven&rsquo;t much
faith in a spiritual existence,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you faith in?&rdquo; I asked, shocked
to hear him speak so lightly on his death-bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Shintoists believe in our ancestors,&rdquo; said
the Prince mockingly, I thought; &ldquo;and that has
always made us more sensible than our Buddhist
neighbors. Also I have studied Christianity,
Mohammedanism and Theosophy, and they have
led me to admire Confucius more. So I get
back to Shintoism in the end. I shall die in the
faith of my ancestors, but not hampered by their
narrow prejudices, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed with this, and I thought his cheeks
looked more sunken and his skin more pallid than
I had yet noticed them. So I said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a trying interview, your Highness,
and you need rest. Shall we retire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated, and then nodded with a return
of his old brightness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send in the doctor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time for
more morphine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;OLD DEATH&rsquo;S-HEAD.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>When we arrived on deck again the wind
had freshened and the pleasant spell of weather
we had lately experienced seemed likely to leave
us. But our gallant <i>Seagull</i> headed the waves
merrily, with scarcely any heaving of her swanlike
body, and we knew her staunchness so well
that we did not dread any weather that might
overtake us.</p>
<p>Finding a sheltered position in the waist, we
three boys eagerly discussed our important interview
with the Prince and the chances of success
in the adventure offered us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made everything so blamed easy for us
that it&rsquo;s like taking candy from a babe,&rdquo; said
Archie, gleefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has certainly proved himself a generous
friend,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he must die.
I&rsquo;d rather have him alive and my friend, than to
get the treasure. Eh, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered Joe, in his quiet voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the chap, too,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;but our
sentiment won&rsquo;t alter the facts in the case, will
it? Here&rsquo;s a treasure&mdash;and a whopper, too, I
imagine&mdash;calling to us to come and take it,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s Mai Lo, who wants it himself,&rdquo;
added Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, him!&rdquo; cried Archie, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said I, thoughtfully; &ldquo;Mai Lo is
a power to be reckoned with. Even the Prince
fears him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Archie, &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s a
dummy. Anyone that&rsquo;ll kow-tow and get on his
knees the way this fellow does, is a coward and a
sneak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; said Joe, softly, &ldquo;calls him &lsquo;Old
Death&rsquo;s-Head.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both started at this; but Archie, recovering
courage, asked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can one miserable Chinaman do, opposed
to three Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, in America,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;re going to his own country, to China, where
old Death&rsquo;s-Head is a high mandarin, and the
governor of a province. He won&rsquo;t kow-tow
there, for the Prince is his only superior, and the
Prince will be deep under the ocean soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thought this over. There was usually
something to think over when Joe made a long
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, then, that you&rsquo;re scared out;
that you won&rsquo;t undertake this thing?&rdquo; demanded
Archie, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to China. That
is, if you fellows are game to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re putting our heads in the jaws of
a trap, and the least little thing is likely to spring
it,&rdquo; added Joe.</p>
<p>Archie looked puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why you take that view
of it,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;It seems to me the thing&rsquo;s
easy enough. We&rsquo;ve got the Prince&rsquo;s letter to
his people, and the ring, and the secret of the
private way into his ancestral hall. If we bungle
such a job as that, we ought to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will be, or worse. So we mustn&rsquo;t bungle
it,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Where is this province of Kwang-Kai-Nong,
Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to ask,&rdquo; I replied, wondering at my
oversight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China&rsquo;s a big country,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ll inquire about the location, and
how to get to it, the next time I see the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll help a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t see the Prince again. At the
lunch table we found the doctor, eating with apparent
gusto but with an intent look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your patient, Doc?&rdquo; Uncle Naboth
was asking as I entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m out of a job again,&rdquo; replied Doctor
Gaylord, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Goodness! The man ain&rsquo;t dead, is he?&rdquo;
demanded my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>I do not know why I had such a sudden sinking
of the heart as I heard this. Perhaps the
noble young Chinaman had won from me more
admiration and affection than I had suspected,
during the brief time I had known him.</p>
<p>I glanced at Joe and Archie, and they were
looking mighty solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it rather sudden, Doc?&rdquo; inquired
Uncle Naboth, after a pause, during which he
stirred his tea energetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he might have lived another four-and-twenty
hours. But he wore out the morphine and
began to suffer terribly. So I killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave him an overdose of morphine, at his own
request, and he went to his long sleep with a
smile of gratitude upon his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said Capt. Steele, clearing his throat,
&ldquo;was that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;strictly professional, Dr.
Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was strictly humane, Captain. The man
was crushed and mangled from the waist down,
and according to all the laws of science and common-sense
has been as good as dead ever since
the accident. He couldn&rsquo;t have lived until now
without the morphine. When that failed to
soothe him the end was bound to creep nearer by
slow degrees, allowing him to suffer horrible torments.
I couldn&rsquo;t stand that, and he couldn&rsquo;t.
So he begged me to end it for him, and I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good man, Gaylord,&rdquo; remarked
Uncle Naboth, mopping his bald head with his
red bandanna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you had the courage
to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Prince of China,&rdquo; said the doctor, leaning
back in his chair and thrusting his hands in
his pockets, &ldquo;was a royal good fellow. I had observed
him on shipboard, and was attracted by
his cheerful, intelligent face. When the <i>Karamata
Maru</i> broke up I left everyone else to attend
to Kai Lun Pu, until I discovered he was fatally
injured. Unfortunately all my surgical tools and
requirements were out of reach, and in the pockets
of the clothes which I grabbed up before I
rushed on deck were only a small medicine case
and my hypodermic outfit. I assisted Mai Lo,
the only one of the Prince&rsquo;s attendants who survived,
to get Kai off the wreck and safe aboard
this ship, and at his urgent request I remained
with him, since the doctor of the <i>Nagasaki Maru</i>
could look after the few survivors of the <i>Karamata
Maru</i> who were injured. I am well paid
for doing this, but I want to state that the money
did not influence me in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>To look at the doctor was evidence of the
truth of this statement; so we merely nodded
assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I had him settled in your cabin
yonder,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I told him that he was
dying. Kai accepted the decree like a philosopher
and asked me how long I could keep him
alive without suffering. It was then that we
made our bargain, and I promised he should die
comfortably. It seems he had certain family
affairs to arrange with Mai Lo, who represents
him in his province, and afterward he had several
long talks with Sam and the other boys here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to look from one to the other of us
curiously, and the shrewd glance from beneath
his prominent gray eyebrows was rather disconcerting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;By good luck,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the Prince finished
his arrangements, whatever they were, before
the effect of the morphine wore out. When
I went to him a while ago I saw the time had
come to fulfil my promise. I asked him if he
was ready and he said he was. So, in the parlance
of the Chinese, he sleeps with his ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence that followed we were all busy
with our own thoughts. Finally my father
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mai Lo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning prayers before the body. He&rsquo;s
going to make trouble for us, pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Chinese believe it&rsquo;s a lasting disgrace
to allow their bodies to be buried anywhere but
at home. Mai Lo has already asked me when I
would embalm the body; but I&rsquo;ve been making
inquiries and find there&rsquo;s no material aboard the
<i>Seagull</i> that will enable me to preserve the
corpse of Kai Lun Pu until we can get him to
China. He himself understood this, and was
willing to be cast overboard; but old Death&rsquo;s-Head
has different ideas, and when he learns
what we are going to do he will make trouble, as
I said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can he do?&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Chinese have a disagreeable way of
running amuck and slicing a few people into
mincemeat before they can be overcome. I won&rsquo;t
say Mai Lo will do that, but he will do something&mdash;anything
in his power to prevent us lowering
his master&rsquo;s body into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t run amuck,&rdquo; said I, positively; &ldquo;nor
will he do anything that will endanger his own
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Sam?&rdquo; asked my father. &ldquo;Mai
Lo&rsquo;s a queer chap. I can&rsquo;t make him out at all.
Seems to me he&rsquo;s likely to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except endanger himself,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;The
Prince knew Mai Lo better than anyone, and
from what he told me I believe Mai&rsquo;s more clever
than you suppose, and too ambitious to sacrifice
his life for a mere whim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a mere whim,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;The Shintoists are ancestor worshippers, and
the sacredness of a dead body is part of their religion.
Mai Lo, if he&rsquo;s a good Shintoist, believes
he himself will be condemned by the spirits of his
own ancestors if he allows his master to be cast
into the sea, whence it is impossible he can be resurrected
when the end of the world comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>is</i> Mai Lo a good Shintoist?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. He claims to be; but
the fellow puzzles me. Many of the Chinese
wear a mask of expressionless reserve; but Mai
Lo is the most incomprehensible being I have ever
met. If he weren&rsquo;t clever he wouldn&rsquo;t be a high
mandarin, so we can&rsquo;t judge him by his terracotta
face and beady eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; remarked my father, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t
endanger our own health by keeping a decaying
body on board, so whenever you&rsquo;re ready for the
ceremony, Doctor, we will give the Prince as
decent a sea-burial as possible. And that in spite
of the old mandarin. By the way, Sam, see if
Mai Lo wants anything to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>I arose and knocked softly upon the door of
the state cabin. Presently it was opened a mere
crack and I caught a glimpse of Mai Lo&rsquo;s expressionless
face behind it. But when he saw me he
closed the door again quickly, before I had time
to speak; and I heard the key click in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the beast starve,&rdquo; I growled, turning
away to go on deck; and the others seemed to
approve the sentiment, for they followed me without
protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE BECOME CONSPIRATORS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find my first suggestion was good,&rdquo;
said Archie, as we stood in the shelter of the
wheel-house, for the wind was half a gale by this
time. &ldquo;The proper thing to do is to chuck old
Death&rsquo;s-Head overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would certainly simplify matters,&rdquo; I agreed;
&ldquo;but unfortunately it can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we ought to cultivate his friendship,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but it&rsquo;s a great mistake to
allow him to think he&rsquo;s our enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go into his province to get
the treasure. He&rsquo;s powerful there, and we need
his good will. He might make it pretty hot for
us otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Archie, gloomily. &ldquo;But
you can&rsquo;t cultivate the friendship of a dummy.
He won&rsquo;t respond worth a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have <i>some</i> sentiment,&rdquo; suggested
Joe; &ldquo;his faithfulness to his Prince proves that.
Let&rsquo;s study him and try to discover how to reach
his gratitude, or self-esteem, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to further his ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Prince is buried at sea,&rdquo; I said, reflectively,
&ldquo;Mai Lo will be disgraced at home.
If we can save him from this disgrace he ought
to be grateful, for it will give him a chance to
carry out his ambitious plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was obliged to commit suicide,&rdquo;
said Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he is; but not immediately. First he
must settle his master&rsquo;s affairs, and that business
ought to provide pretty fair pickings for an
unscrupulous man. Then he will be obliged to
seal up the ancestral hall and destroy all traces
of any entrance to it, or even its existence. All
this takes time, and will give him a chance to
complete his plans for running away with his
plunder, most of which will be stolen from the
tombs of the Prince&rsquo;s ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he dare do that?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo has seen a good deal of the world
outside of China,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and such experience
is bound to destroy many of the doctrines of his
religious belief. Contact with our western civilization
made the Prince an unbeliever in Shintoism,
and perhaps did the same for Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why is he so set on lugging the body
of the Prince to China? He must know that this
ancestor worship is a humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does. Also he knows that his people at
home are still firm believers in it. It is to save
himself from disgrace that he will insist on
taking the body home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; responded Archie. &ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t do
that, you know. There&rsquo;s no way to embalm the
Prince properly, and Captain Steele has already
decided to drop the body overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking aft I saw the doctor pacing the quarter-deck
with his pipe in his mouth, and suddenly
the sight inspired me with an idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to have some help
in this affair. We can&rsquo;t carry out the adventure
all alone. Suppose we ask the doctor to join
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He has good stuff in him, to my notion;
and he says he&rsquo;s out of a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he ask for too big a slice of the pie?&rdquo;
inquired Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the Prince there&rsquo;s more treasure
in his ancestral halls than we could cart away
in a year. If Dr. Gaylord will help us we won&rsquo;t
lose anything by giving him his share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he can help us a bit,&rdquo; declared
Archie. &ldquo;For my part I&rsquo;d rather have
Ned Britton or Mr. Perkins. They&rsquo;re true blue
and game to fight to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a matter that depends on fighting,
Archie,&rdquo; I reminded him. &ldquo;Our whole ship&rsquo;s
crew wouldn&rsquo;t make a showing against the thousands
of Chinamen if it came to open warfare.
It&rsquo;s a question of ready wit, courage and
audacity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t make out why you want the
doctor,&rdquo; returned Archie, with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Joe, in his quiet voice. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ve caught Sam&rsquo;s idea, and it&rsquo;s a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the doctor&rsquo;s help we can fool Mai Lo
and save him from disgrace. And that will win
his gratitude. Eh, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Joe. Shall I call the doctor
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded, and at my summons Dr. Gaylord
willingly joined our little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a conspiracy afloat.
Do you want to join it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me a shrewd glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something up,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been trying to study out what secret
Prince Kai confided to you. It has worried me
almost as much as it has Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I, with a gasp. &ldquo;Does <i>he</i> suspect
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo is no fool, and you were closeted with
Prince Kai a long time. Also, he witnessed an
important paper, and I heard him ask the Prince
what had become of his ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the reply?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Kai told him he had given it to Sam
Steele for an important purpose, and that he had
appointed you to carry out his secret wishes.
Also he exacted a promise from Mai Lo to obey
you and render you any assistance you might
demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good as far as it goes,&rdquo; said the doctor,
drily; &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t go far with Mai Lo. He&rsquo;s
likely to cut your throat some night if you leave
your door unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you distrust him?&rdquo; I asked, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that, Sam. I&rsquo;m afraid of him.
But let me have your story and your proposal,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you in a jiffy whether I&rsquo;ll join your
conspiracy or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>So I began by relating in full my various
interviews with Prince Kai, in the last of which
Archie and Joe had been participants. I added
that I believed the Prince&rsquo;s idea of our robbing
his ancestors arose from my relation of our former
adventures in search of a treasure, which I
had told him with a view to amusing him. Once
the mischievous notion had seized him, he began
to plan ways to assist us, and I think he derived
a certain pleasure during his last hours in
imagining our difficulties and trying to overcome
them. Another thing that doubtless influenced
him was the desire to outwit Mai Lo, whom he
suspected, probably with good reason, of a desire
to rob the tombs himself.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaylord listened to all the story without
interruption, and I could see that he was intensely
interested. When I finished he smoked for a
time in silence, while we watched him rather
anxiously. Finally he knocked the ashes from
his pipe and said, with decision:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks too pretty to miss, my lads, and if
you see where an old fellow like me can be of
use to you, I&rsquo;ll stand by to the last. But I want
to warn you that we are taking big chances in
this adventure, and if any one of us escapes with
a whole skin he&rsquo;ll be lucky. On the other hand,
I know something of the enormous wealth of
these ancestral halls, and if we succeed in our
undertaking our fortunes will be made. That
won&rsquo;t mean much to you youngsters, of course;
but it will enable me to buy a snug farm in
England and settle down to end my days in
peace. So I&rsquo;m with you, lads, and you can count
on my venturing as much as any of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know in what part of China the province
of Kwang-Kai-Nong is, doctor?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. It&rsquo;s away up in the northwest, in
the foothills of the Himalayas&mdash;a most retired
and out-of-the-way place; and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
going to make our task doubly hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we get there?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By starting at Shanghai, traveling up the
Yang-tse-Kiang a thousand miles or so to Ichang,
and then cutting across country by elephant-train
to the edge of the world, which is the province
of Kwang-Kai-Nong. That&rsquo;s not very definite,
is it? But the road to Kai-Nong, the capital, is
probably well known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo will show us the way,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at me blankly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be obliged to take my father and
Uncle Naboth into our confidence soon,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;for the <i>Seagull</i> must make straight
for Woosung anchorage, so that we may escort
the body of Prince Kai to Shanghai, and up the
Yang-tse, while our ship goes to Canton to unload.
Then they can pick us up when we return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Dr. Gaylord, testily, &ldquo;have
you gone crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s this nonsense about escorting
Prince Kai&rsquo;s body&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Kai-Nong, so he may rest with his ancestors,&rdquo;
I interrupted. &ldquo;That will save Mai Lo
from disgrace, and will enable him to return home
in triumph. To do this, he will gladly show
us the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s stare turned to a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So that is
why you wanted me to join your party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get along
without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the spoils of war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There shall be an equal division.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Very good
indeed. The conspiracy is an established fact,
and the conspirators are bound to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile I glanced over his shoulder to
where a motionless form stood by the rail gazing
steadfastly into the sea. The man was too far
away to have overheard us, but the sight of him
froze my smile in an instant.</p>
<p>It was Mai Lo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said abruptly; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go below and
talk it over. It&rsquo;s getting chilly here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DR. GAYLORD&rsquo;S PROPOSAL.</span></h2>
<p>The doctor and I had an important interview
with Mai Lo that very evening. The man was
evidently on guard before the door of his dead
master&rsquo;s room; for, the moment one of us approached
the state cabin, there was Mai Lo confronting
him, although the mandarin had been
seen at quite another part of the ship a short
time before. At such times the expressionless
face and unfathomable beady eyes were turned
toward us like those of a basilisk, and they impressed
me with an uneasy sensation in spite of
the fact that I felt that he alone was helpless to
oppose us in anything we might decide to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>But it was not our cue at present to antagonize
Mai Lo, but to win his confidence. My father
had already loudly declared in the Manchu&rsquo;s hearing
that the body of Prince Kai must be buried
at sea, and considering Mai Lo&rsquo;s prejudices it
was not unreasonable to suppose that he looked
upon us as his enemies.</p>
<p>Our first act in the comedy we were playing
was to send Uncle Naboth to explain to the attendant
that Captain Steele regretted the necessity
of disposing of the body of his master at sea;
but because the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> medicine chest
contained no drugs or chemicals with which to
embalm or preserve the body, there was no way
to avoid this sea-burial if we wished to preserve
the health of all on board.</p>
<p>Mai listened in apparent apathy to this explanation,
which he had doubtless understood before,
and the doctor and I waited a couple of hours
to give him time to think it over before we
sought him out and with mysterious gestures
beckoned him to follow us to my own cabin.
This he did, but would not close the door and
sat in a position where he could keep an eye upon
the locked door of the state cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you know that Prince Kai
and I became friends before he died, and that he
wished me to go to his palace at Kai-Nong and
there perform for him certain services, the details
of which are secret and must not be confided
to anyone&mdash;even to you, his most faithful
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened to me calmly, and then nodded his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince well knew his body would be
lowered into the waters of the sea,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;and he was resigned to the necessity. We
Americans do not care very much what becomes
of our bodies when we are dead, but I know you
Chinese feel differently about it, and it has made
me unhappy to think I could not take the body
of my friend Kai to China and place it in the
burial-halls of his ancestors. Dr. Gaylord and I
were conversing upon this subject, a short time
ago, when he informed me that his science had
taught him a way to preserve a body for a long
period without the use of the usual drugs; but it is
a method that requires great skill and labor, and
constant watching, and is, moreover, very
expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>By this time Mai Lo was intensely interested;
there was no doubt of that. His gaze was fixed
steadfastly upon my face and I thought there was
a faint gleam of curiosity in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was silent at first; but I intended he should
speak, and after a long pause he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The expense,&rdquo; said he, in a harsh, guttural
voice, but fair English, &ldquo;is not to be considered.
The estates of Prince Kai are ample to meet any
demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; I replied easily. &ldquo;Were it not so,
my own fortune would willingly be devoted to
the honor of my friend. The question is not one
of money, but whether we can prevail upon Doctor
Gaylord to give us his time and services. He
says the task is a difficult one; and, if he undertakes
to preserve the body of my friend and your
master, he must watch over it constantly and
escort it in person to the halls of Prince Kai&rsquo;s
ancestors. I have promised to go with him and
to take two of my own friends to assist him and
guard him; but the doctor knows something of
China and fears he will be molested and perhaps
lose his life during the long journey to the province
of Kwang-Kai-Nong and back again to
Shanghai. It is this that makes him refuse the
undertaking, so I have decided to ask you if you
cannot help us, and relieve Doctor Gaylord of
his fears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>I spoke slowly, so that each word might be
fully understood by the Chinaman, and it was
not long before he answered me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is a safe country at all times,&rdquo; said
Mai Lo, and I noticed that his raspy, guttural
tones were as expressionless as his face. &ldquo;But
on this mission, when one is in the service of
Mai Lo, and favoring the powerful family of
Kai, the person of Doctor Gaylord would be
sacred from harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several things about this brief assertion
that I did not like. The mandarin, so
humble and subservient to his Prince that I had
come to regard him as a mere valet, now assumed
that we would be &ldquo;in the service of Mai Lo&rdquo;
during our journey into the interior. Then,
again, our return trip was not assured; it would
only be of interest to Mai Lo to see that we
arrived safely at the capital of Kai-Nong with
the body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>This struck the doctor, too; for he said, in
his positive way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go in safety I must return in safety.
It won&rsquo;t do, Mai Lo, to give me empty promises.
Either you must show me, without the shadow
of a doubt, how I am to return to Shanghai with
my American escort, or I don&rsquo;t stir a step and
the body of Prince Kai goes overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo took a silver box from inside his
richly embroidered robe and abstracted some
betel-nut and lime leaves, which he placed in his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What assurance do you demand?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You will yourself
remain on board the <i>Seagull</i> as an hostage,
until we return from Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo remained silent a long time, while we
watched him anxiously. At last he spoke, as
deliberately as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imperil your own safety by this request,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Without me to protect you, your party
might be attacked and slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said China was perfectly safe!&rdquo;
I exclaimed, contemptuously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly safe wherever I go,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>We were both greatly disappointed at this
position of Mai Lo, for we had thought that by
leaving him on board the ship we could carry
out our plans safely. China might be a dangerous
country to travel in, but we feared this
incomprehensible mandarin more than anything
else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the doctor, carelessly, &ldquo;let us
abandon the idea altogether. I don&rsquo;t want the
job, to be frank with you both, and I won&rsquo;t run
my head into danger if I can help it. So we&rsquo;ll
say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE OUTWIT MAI LO.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are other ways to assure your safety,&rdquo;
said Mai Lo, as the doctor rose as if to go.</p>
<p>Then he turned his face toward me and
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot the friend of Prince Kai trust the
promises of his friend&rsquo;s servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The Prince himself told me
to trust no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have his letter of authority and his ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; I answered, with a shrug. &ldquo;I
am not sure the commands of the dead Prince
are as powerful as those of his living servant. I
am told you are all-powerful in Kai-Nong, Mai
Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We who worship our ancestors obey the commands
of the dead without question, even if it
costs us our lives,&rdquo; said the mandarin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>This might be true, but I had little faith in
Mai Lo being influenced by the traditions of his
people. Prince Kai had distrusted the man and
warned me to look out for any treachery from
him. But it was not my purpose to antagonize
the mandarin at this juncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfy the doctor, and you satisfy me,&rdquo; I
declared, with assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write an agreement,&rdquo; said Mai Lo, &ldquo;in
which I promise you safe conduct to Kai-Nong
and back to Shanghai. This you will deposit with
the American Consul at Shanghai. If I fail in
my agreement he will send the paper to the Emperor,
who will at once order me beheaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the doctor, somewhat to my
surprise. &ldquo;That will satisfy us amply. Write
the agreement and I will at once begin work
upon the body of Prince Kai. If I am to succeed
no time must be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the price?&rdquo; asked the mandarin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand taels, and all expenses of the
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo composedly arose and went to the state
cabin, which he entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well to accept his terms,&rdquo; said the
doctor to me, in a low voice. &ldquo;What we want is
to impress him with the fact that we rely upon
his protection. Then we&rsquo;ll watch him for evidences
of treachery and be upon our guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the Emperor behead him if he played
false?&rdquo; I asked, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly. Tsi An doesn&rsquo;t want any trouble
with foreign countries just now, and when we
speak of the Emperor we really mean the old
dowager, Tsi An.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the Chinaman returned and handed
the doctor a paper closely written upon in Chinese
characters. I looked at the document rather suspiciously,
being unable to read it; but the doctor
promptly folded it and put it in his pocket-book.
Then he said in a brisk and business-like tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to the Prince, Mai Lo. I must get
to work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Work he did, and to all appearances very energetically.
While he made his preliminary arrangements
I had a long talk with father and
Uncle Naboth, and after explaining to them the
details of the entire adventure I obtained their
permission to carry it out. Uncle Naboth wanted
to go with us to &ldquo;see the country,&rdquo; he said; but
I pointed out that it was a long and tedious
journey which my respected relative might not
enjoy, being quite stout and rather short of
breath. Moreover, the cargo of merchandise we
were carrying needed his attention; and, if we
boys failed to secure the treasure we were to
hunt for, it would be as well to make the trip a
profitable one in a more legitimate way. Finally
it was arranged that only Archie, Joe and I should
proceed to Kwang-Kai-Nong in the doctor&rsquo;s company,
with the two black South Sea Islanders,
Nux and Bryonia, for body-servants. Numbers
would not count for much in the expedition,
while courage, wit and caution would accomplish
more than an army.</p>
<p>It would only delay the <i>Seagull</i> a few
days to stop at Woosung anchorage before proceeding
to Hong Kong on the way to Canton
to unload cargo, and the prospect of rich returns
for this delay fully warranted it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>These matters being arranged, and my father
and Uncle Naboth being acquainted with the
doctor&rsquo;s secret plans, we proceeded quietly to
complete our arrangements.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaylord employed only the services of Mai
Lo to prepare the body of his Prince for the
process of preservation, and it must be admitted
that the mandarin worked faithfully and willingly&mdash;almost
I had said cheerfully, except that such
a word could never be applied to the unemotional
Mai Lo.</p>
<p>These preparations being completed at midnight,
Dr. Gaylord drove the attendant away,
claiming that his &ldquo;secret process&rdquo; would not allow
the presence of any one. And then the doctor,
as he afterward told me, rolled himself up in a
blanket and behind the locked door slept peacefully
in the presence of the corpse until morning.</p>
<p>Nor was Mai Lo again admitted to the state
cabin, although he maintained his position as
guard outside the door, both day and night.</p>
<p>As soon as breakfast was over I went to the
carpenter and had him make a pine box for a
coffin. This we covered with black cloth and
clamped with heavy bands of iron. The cover
was hinged and fastened down with three Yale
locks, in addition to a row of stout screws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>This funeral strong-box was completed about
the middle of the afternoon, and Archie, Joe and
I lugged it down to the saloon and deposited it
before the door of the state cabin.</p>
<p>Very soon the doctor came out with his sleeves
rolled up and looking very business-like, although
he had been reading a novel all day. He, also,
approved the chest; so we solemnly carried it
into the state cabin and deposited it upon the
floor. Mai Lo was ordered to remain at the
door, but he kept it open and watched us intently
from his position there. The body lay upon the
bunk swathed from head to foot in bandages,
which were thoroughly dampened, and gave out
an odor which I knew to be rum, as I had conveyed
several bottles of this liquor to the room,
concealed in a gunny sack to puzzle Mai Lo.</p>
<p>The lid of the Coffin being laid back, we gently
lifted the body of the Prince in our arms and
deposited it in the box, wrappings and all. Then
the doctor sprinkled the corpse with more rum
from a jar, and closed the lid and locked it,
placing the keys in his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is all right, so far,&rdquo; he remarked
to Mai Lo, as he put on his coat and prepared
to leave the room. &ldquo;It will be necessary for me
to sprinkle the body with my secret preparation
every few hours, especially during the next week
or ten days. In this work I shall require the
services of Sam Steele only. You will keep out
of this room, my man, and prevent any one from
entering it without my orders, as the fumes of
the drugs might cause another death aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo nodded and locked the door behind us,
and I was greatly pleased that the doctor had
succeeded so far in his imposition.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock the doctor and I again entered
the state cabin and remained there for half an
hour, leaning out of the port-hole, which was
extra large in this cabin, and conversing together
in low tones. Then we emerged and passed the
evening as usual, everyone on board seeming to
take little interest in the fact that we had a dead
man in the state cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The sailors, always a superstitious and suspicious
lot, had asked some questions of Archie
and Joe, but when told that the doctor had preserved
the body, which was to be taken to Shanghai,
they seemed satisfied with the situation,
although I knew every man Jack would have been
relieved to see the corpse lowered into the sea.</p>
<p>The doctor rapped on my door at midnight,
although I was not asleep and had been eagerly
awaiting the summons.</p>
<p>Together we entered the state cabin, the door
of which was unlocked by Mai Lo, who seemed
perpetually sleepless and alert. We first bolted
the door to prevent intrusion, and then lighted a
lamp and began preparations for the most important
act in our comedy.</p>
<p>My heart was beating strongly as I assisted
the doctor to unlock the lid of the box and
silently lay it back. Then we lifted out the
corpse and the doctor swiftly and skillfully removed
the bandages, disclosing the still smiling
face of the dead Prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>We had smuggled in at various times several
heavy pieces of iron, and these were now congregated
in a gunny sack. We attached this
sack to the feet of the body, carried it to the
port-hole and slid it out into the water. It
disappeared into the night almost without a
sound, although I thought I heard a faint splash
at the stern.</p>
<p>But now our task was only half accomplished.
Bolsters and blankets were bound together in
such shape that they resembled in outline the
form of the Prince. Then the doctor carefully
bandaged it, and when the dummy was put in
the coffin to replace the corpse it was difficult to
realize the substitution. With a sigh of relief we
moistened the bandages anew with rum, and then
closed and locked the lid.</p>
<p>Mai Lo was at his post when we left the state
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is progressing finely,&rdquo; remarked
the doctor; but the stolid attendant made no
reply and we passed on to our own cabins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNHEEDED WARNING.</span></h2>
<p>The voyage of the <i>Seagull</i> across the Pacific
was safely accomplished and with excellent speed.
We crossed the Yellow Sea without incident and
in due time anchored at Woosung, which is at
the mouth of the Yang-tse-Kiang. This river
is navigable for small steamers for several hundred
miles, but the yellow mud that it washes
down from the foothills of the interior mountain
ranges forms a huge bar across the mouth, which
ocean steamships cannot cross. So passengers
are obliged to disembark at Woosung and take
either the railway or a small steamer for the
twenty-five mile run up to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mai Lo decided upon the steamer. As soon
as we anchored we went ashore and made arrangements,
and on the following morning our
little party prepared to follow him, and start at
once upon our strange adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The Chinese Health Inspector for the port was
curious and exacting. He made us unlock the
coffin of Prince Kai and when the swathed figure
was exposed he prodded it cautiously with his
bamboo wand. Mai Lo was indignant at this
outrage, and protested so vigorously that the official
refrained from further investigation. He
countersigned the doctor&rsquo;s certificate of death from
accidental injury, and allowed us to proceed.</p>
<p>Until this time we had been uneasy lest Mai Lo
should suspect the imposture we had practiced.
He had remained so stolid and indifferent that,
although we had allowed him at various times
to see us saturating the bandaged form with our
rum, we could not feel really assured that he
believed the corpse of Prince Kai was still in
our keeping. But the mandarin&rsquo;s genuine anger
at the meddling official&mdash;if voluble and brusque
phrases in Chinese may be construed as anger&mdash;fully
restored our confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The chest was solemnly rowed to the quay,
just beneath one of the mud forts, and placed
aboard a smart little river steamer that was puffing
a cloud of black smoke from its funnel.
Uncle Naboth came off with us in another boat,
for he was to accompany us as far as Shanghai
and see us started upon our real journey up the
Yang-tse. We carried light baggage, but concealed
about our persons a plentiful supply of
arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Less than half a day&rsquo;s ride upon the winding
yellow waters of the river brought us to the important
city of Shanghai&mdash;the most important in
all the Province of Chili.</p>
<p>The doctor and I insisted upon conveying the
important casket to the Astor House, where we
were to stop, and the proprietor gave us a private
room for it in an outbuilding and appointed several
Chinese servants to guard the supposed corpse
of the Prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Here, during the next few days, came several
Chinese relatives of the dead man to burn
prayers for his peaceful repose before the little
image of a god and the wooden ancestral tablets
which Mai Lo had set up at the head of the
casket. These prayers were printed in Chinese
characters upon rice paper, and when burned before
the god were considered very efficacious.</p>
<p>At times the doctor and I continued to treat
the bandages with rum, for although Mai Lo
was not often present upon these occasions we
feared he might have spies set to watch us, and
so dared not neglect our functions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The mandarin lived, during these days of our
stay in Shanghai, in the native city, and said he
was busy perfecting arrangements for our long
trip to the Province of Kwang-Kai-Nong.</p>
<p>Shanghai consists of a native city and an European
city, besides four conceded districts occupied
by Americans, French, English and Germans.
These grants or concessions have their own judicial
courts and are guarded by their national
marines, so that we found our surroundings
wholly American, and plenty of American faces
greeted us in our country&rsquo;s section of the city.</p>
<p>This was at first quite reassuring; but one had
only to walk into the European section, patrolled
by the handsome and gigantic Indian Sikhs, or
into the dirty native city, to realize that we were
indeed upon foreign territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>One of our first errands after our arrival was
to visit the American Consul, who received us
very courteously. We told him of our contract
to escort the body of Prince Kai Lun Pu to the
province of Kwang-Kai-Nong, and that our
agreement with Mai Lo provided for our safe
return to Shanghai. He shook his head dubiously
and asked to see the contract. This we produced,
and waited patiently while the consul&rsquo;s interpreter
translated it in writing. When reduced to English
the paper read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the obligation which Mai Lo, High
Mandarin and Governor of the province of
Kwang-Kai-Nong, in His Imperial Chinese Majesty&rsquo;s
Domain, hereby voluntarily agrees to
perform:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo will escort in honor and safety the
person of the renowned physician Gregory Gaylord,
a subject of the Kingdom of England, from
the City of Shanghai, in the Province of Chili,
to the City of Kai-Nong in the Province of
Kwang-Kai-Nong, and with him shall go the
Americans known as Sam Steele, Archie Ackley,
and Joe Herring, with their attendants, all in
equal honor and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Doctor Gregory Gaylord shall conduct
the corpse of His Royal Highness the Revered
Prince Kai Lun Pu, well preserved and
cared for, upon this journey to the City of
Kai-Nong, then will Mai Lo pay to this Doctor
Gregory Gaylord the sum of ten thousand taels
in genuine money of the Empire of China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the Englishman and the Americans
and their attendants before mentioned do conduct
themselves with honesty and faith, neither stealing
nor murdering upon the journey or while
within the City of Kai-Nong, then shall Mai Lo
escort them each and every one in honor and
safety back again to the City of Shanghai and
deliver them to the American Consul in that city,
unharmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this Mai Lo shall do as soon as the foreign
guests shall together or separately make
request to return to Shanghai, and all of the expenses
of guards and of food and of transportation
shall be defrayed from the private purse of
Mai Lo, as a part of his contract and obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mai Lo, promising to be faithful in the
names of his greatly worshipped ancestors, agrees
to do and will do, or forfeit his life, his rank and
his fortune. And that all men may know his
intentions he has here signed his name in witness.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Mai Lo.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The doctor and I each read this translation in
silence, but afterward glanced at one another with
grim forebodings. But the consul, who was
studying another copy, said to us thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This agreement is more frank and favorable
than I feared it would prove. Usually these unscrupulous
mandarins insert such clauses in their
contracts that their subtle meanings may be construed
in various ways, thus giving them opportunities
to violate the real meaning of their promises.
But here is a paper of a different sort,
direct and concise and with no subterfuges. I
think you may trust yourselves to Mai Lo, especially
as he knows this document is in my possession;
and I will inquire carefully into the matter
should any harm befall you. Without the
good-will of this powerful governor, however, I
would advise you not to undertake the dangerous
journey into the far-away province of Kwang-Kai-Nong.
Indeed, I warn you that the City of
Kai-Nong has considerable evil repute, and is seldom
visited by Americans or Europeans. But
Mai Lo is able to protect you even in that remote
capital.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go,&rdquo; replied the doctor, briefly.
&ldquo;But if we do not return by the first of September
you must make inquiries concerning us; and
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo; said the consul, with an amused glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find we&rsquo;ve disappeared, or anything
has happened to us, please see that Mai Lo is
punished,&rdquo; concluded the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do all in my power,&rdquo; responded the
consul. &ldquo;The Chinese character is complex, and
crafty beyond measure. But I am sure Mai Lo
would not have executed this document unless he
meant fairly by you. I shall lock the original
up in my safe, and you may keep the translation
to refer to in case of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>We thanked him and went our way, rather
more gloomy than the consul suspected. For
we could not tell the American representative that
our errand to Kai-Nong was to carry away the
treasure from Prince Kai&rsquo;s ancestral halls, and
that if we were caught doing this, Mai Lo might
easily construe our act as one of theft, and have
us put to death. It did not matter that we were
acting according to the Prince&rsquo;s expressed wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo must have suspected why we wanted
to go to Kai-Nong, and so have put in that dangerous
clause,&rdquo; I said to the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; the fellow has entrapped us very cleverly,&rdquo;
replied Doctor Gaylord. &ldquo;Yet he may be
innocent of any intent to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to bank on that,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The
consul knows the Chinese, and he says they are
crafty. Mai Lo seems to have no more intelligence
than a lump of putty, but for that reason
he&rsquo;s doubly dangerous. You can&rsquo;t tell how much
he knows, or what he thinks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we object to that clause in the agreement,
we shall acknowledge evil intentions on our
part,&rdquo; remarked the doctor; &ldquo;and, if we say
nothing, he may find a way to use that same
clause to excuse himself for our murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone into this
thing, and I&rsquo;m going to stay in&mdash;to the finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied Doctor Gaylord; but I did
not like the way he said it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNEXPECTED DESERTION.</span></h2>
<p>No one can gain any adequate idea of the magnitude
of the Empire of China until he has
journeyed up that great waterway, the Yang-tse-Kiang,
and observed the millions upon millions
of natives that throng both the river and
its banks. For the first four hundred miles of
its twisting, serpentine course, the Yang-tse
seems to wind through one successive village,
back of which the skilfully cultivated gardens
and fields are visible. The people as a rule seem
peaceful and plodding; but we soon discovered a
deep-rooted antipathy for foreigners in their character
which induced them to regard us with
scowling countenances or mischievous jeers.
Whenever we tied up at the river-bank they
crowded around to mock us and make faces at
us like a pack of unruly schoolboys, and we began
to realize that we would be far from safe if we
ventured among them unprotected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Our steamer was a wheezy little flat-bottomed
affair, which in spite of its awkward appearance
breasted the stream energetically and made fairly
good time. It had been chartered especially for
our party by Mai Lo, and was to carry us as far
as Ichang, where we were to take mules and
elephants to Kai-Nong.</p>
<p>Mai Lo was now a vastly different personage
from the humble and groveling attendant of
Prince Kai whom we had first known. He
boarded the steamer at Shanghai clothed in gorgeous
Chinese raiment of embroidered silks and
accompanied by a band of servitors from his own
province, whom he had picked up in the city. He
was as silent and undemonstrative as ever, but
had assumed a new dignity of demeanor. His
commands were obeyed by all around him as
readily as if he had been an autocrat, or the Emperor
himself, and whenever he spoke to any of
our party, which was but seldom, there was a
suspicion of a sneer in his harsh tones that was
very annoying, although his words were so courteous
that we could not well find fault with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>It mattered very little to Archie, Joe or myself
that Mai Lo assumed these airs, but the
doctor was uneasy and discontented, and more
than once expressed regrets that we had been
foolish enough to undertake such a risky adventure.
Yet he continued to perform the duties
he had undertaken in a brisk, businesslike manner.
At least three or four times in every
twenty-four hours the doctor and I entered the
little room where the supposed body of the
Prince had been placed in state, surrounded by
flags and decorations, and moistened the bandages
with the rum. We had brought with us
three large demijohns of the liquor, which Doctor
Gaylord had labelled &ldquo;poison,&rdquo; so that we might
continue the farce until the end of our journey.</p>
<p>Mai Lo, however, no longer guarded the
corpse of his Prince in the same jealous manner
as he had on board the <i>Seagull</i>. This might
easily be accounted for by the fact that now there
was no danger that could menace the dead. The
Chinese have an intense reverence for a corpse,
and would not molest one under any circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said the doctor, gloomily, &ldquo;I
wish Mai Lo would take a little more interest in
the remains of Prince Kai. His indifference
makes me suspect that the crafty mandarin knows
more than we give him credit for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our little party was accorded excellent treatment
on this voyage, and we had little to complain
of. Our South Sea Islanders had nothing
to do, and received almost as much deference
as ourselves from the Chinese aboard the steamboat,
who looked upon Nux and Bryonia with
unfeigned curiosity. Our blacks were as grave
and dignified as judges, and conducted themselves
in their customary admirable manner. I believe
they had themselves been princes, or at least
nobles, in the half-civilized island from whence
they had come, and certainly their conduct under
trying circumstances had always been such as
to win my confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>We were eight days getting to Ichang, for the
boat tied up at the bank the greater part of each
night, and resumed its journey at daybreak. The
Chinese boatmen have a horror of traveling by
night, except those of the pirate junks, who prefer
the dark to cloak their movements. Sometimes,
of course, it is necessary to travel at night,
and in consequence every Chinese boat has
an eye painted on each side of the bow so that
the boat can see where it is going in the dark
and avoid running aground or into the rocks.</p>
<p>Ichang we found to be another important and
densely populated city, and to my surprise there
were several European travelers there. A regular
line of steamers runs between Ichang and
Shanghai.</p>
<p>Doctor Gaylord met an old friend, a retired
English officer, and seemed overjoyed to see him,
for they held a long and animated conversation
together that evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Mai Lo put us up at the best hotel, but the
proprietor objected to receiving the &ldquo;remains&rdquo; of
Prince Kai, and so the casket was left on board
the steamer until we were ready to start&mdash;the
next morning but one after our arrival. This
made it necessary for the doctor and me to make
trips to the boat from the hotel, since we dared
not neglect any of the useless but impressive
duties we had assumed in caring for the dummy
corpse.</p>
<p>On the first of these excursions we were nearly
mobbed by the natives; but fortunately our entire
band was together and Nux and Bryonia cleared
the way, using freely some stout lengths of
bamboo.</p>
<p>So the rabble did not press us too closely, and
on our following trips to the boat they were
careful not to interfere with us, although they
jeered and mocked &ldquo;the foreign pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attitude of the natives seemed to make
the doctor very nervous; but the others of us
did not mind their silly actions, as it was evident
that we were feared as much as we were hated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It appeared that Mai Lo had arranged for
his caravan in advance&mdash;probably by the Chinese
Imperial Telegraph&mdash;so we were delayed only
two days in Ichang. The evening before we
started Doctor Gaylord was again engaged in
earnest conversation with his tourist acquaintance,
and when we left him to go to bed&mdash;for
we were to start at daybreak next morning&mdash;they
were still talking together.</p>
<p>Joe aroused me next morning while it was
still dark, and told me that I had barely time to
dress and get my breakfast.</p>
<p>When the meal was finished&mdash;and Chinese
breakfasts do not consume much time&mdash;we all
marched down to the river, from the banks of
which the caravan was to start.</p>
<p>There were three elephants and some twenty
spindle-legged mules in the convoy, and our escort
consisted of Chinese warriors carefully selected
by Mai Lo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The casket of Prince Kai was to ride in state
upon one of the elephants, and to be accompanied
by the doctor and myself, as his assistant. The
doctor was late and had not yet arrived, so I
personally directed the removal of the casket from
the cabin of the steamer and saw that it was
carefully loaded upon the elephant and secured
just in front of the howdah. The beast was
profusely decorated with flags and streamers of
gay colors. The Chinese do not use black as
mourning, and this was their way of honoring
the memory of the late Prince. Some of the
flags were embroidered with the regulation Earth
Dragon, but others bore the figure of the Sacred
Ape, which was the especial emblem of the House
of Kai.</p>
<p>The doctor had not yet arrived by the time
the elephant was loaded, and we began to be
impatient. Mai Lo came to me to inquire why
the noble physician was delayed, but I could
not tell him. Messengers were sent back to the
hotel, and in the meantime I watched two of the
puffing, flat-bottomed little river steamers leave
the bank a few rods away and begin a race down
the river toward Shanghai. They had disappeared
around the bend of the river a full half
hour when a native touched my shoulder and
stealthily handed me a soiled bit of crumpled
paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>I found it was a note from the doctor, and to
my astonishment it read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have thrown up the job and gone back to
Shanghai. Too dangerous to tackle. I advise
you to follow my example. Life is worth more
than you can possibly gain.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Gaylord.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said a harsh voice beside me; &ldquo;the noble
physician has run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned with a start to face Mai Lo, who
had insolently read the note over my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; I answered, blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe and Archie, who
were unable to comprehend this desertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone back to Shanghai,&rdquo; I answered, handing
them the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you follow his example?&rdquo; asked Mai
Lo, calmly. &ldquo;I must know at once, as we are
ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We three boys, confronted by this trying emergency,
glanced into one another&rsquo;s eyes; but after
exchanging this look I was prepared to answer
Mai Lo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to Kai-Nong,&rdquo; I said, with an
air of unconcern. &ldquo;Whenever you are ready, we
will begin the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MAI LO MAKES A DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
<p>Mai Lo looked at me a long time in silence.
Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noble physician is old and wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means that we boys are young and
foolish,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;But listen to me, Mai Lo.
We have traveled in many lands, young as we
are. We have had adventures, and faced dangers.
Some who decided to oppose us are lying
buried in Alaska, Panama, and Egypt&mdash;and we
are here to travel in your company to Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not given to boasting, but here was an
occasion when a little bombast might count in
our favor; so I looked Mai Lo squarely in the
eye and took a step nearer to him as I spoke,
that he might understand that I was not afraid.
Moreover, the mandarin was assuming airs of
superiority that I resented. It would never do
to let him believe that we were in his power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>But no one could have told by Mai Lo&rsquo;s expression
whether my speech had impressed him
or not. His eyes were like beads of glass, and
I had begun to believe that there were no muscles
in his face at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your object in traveling to Kai-Nong?&rdquo;
he asked, after one of his irritating
pauses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, that does not concern
you, my man,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;A higher authority
than your own has given me a mission to perform,
and if I have any trouble with you I shall
use the letter and ring of Prince Kai to provide
a separate escort to Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your servant,&rdquo; said Mai Lo, in his
rasping voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not forget it,&rdquo; I rejoined, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will put some of my own people on the
elephant to guard the body of my illustrious master,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I will ride there myself, and perform
the doctor&rsquo;s duties in preserving the body. I
have assisted him so long that I understand the
process perfectly, and I have a duplicate set of
the keys in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Again the mandarin stared at me silently before
he ventured to speak. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary to continue that farce
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my turn to stare now; and I heard
Archie cough softly and Joe give vent to a low
whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farce!&rdquo; I exclaimed indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The body of the mighty and magnificent
Prince Kai is by this time sufficiently preserved.
Save yourself any further trouble concerning
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I intend to carry out the contract,&rdquo; I
declared, hardly knowing how else to reply to
this astounding statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to demand the ten thousand
taels?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. We have earned it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; said Mai Lo, calmly.
&ldquo;This matter is between you and me, and I will
pay you the money in Kai-Nong. But let the casket
alone, hereafter, and save yourself trouble.
Give me the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;In Kai-Nong, when I have the ten thousand
taels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was the ready reply.</p>
<p>My easy victory assured me I was still master
of the situation. For some reason Mai Lo, finding
he could not bulldoze me, was afraid to oppose
me openly.</p>
<p>I ordered Nux and Bryonia to ride upon the
elephant bearing the casket of Prince Kai, and
the mandarin made no objection to the arrangement.
In their native language, which I understood
to some extent, I told the blacks to keep
their eyes open and their weapons handy, and
at a signal from us to hasten to our assistance.
Then Archie, Joe and I mounted the second elephant,
while Mai Lo climbed the third one,
followed by a little withered Chinaman in yellow
dress, whom I had never seen before.</p>
<p>The escort mounted the mules, several of which
bore our light baggage, and then the word was
given to start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Our mahout, or elephant driver, was a small
Chinaman with an enormous head but a merry
and even jovial face that formed a sharp contrast
to that of the impassive Mai Lo. As we started
I asked him a question, to determine if he understood
English, and he replied with a flood of
sing-song Chinese that formed a sentence a mile
long.</p>
<p>We were well out of the city gates before the
speech ended, and when our driver found we had
ceased to pay any attention to him he threw back
his head and laughed as heartily as a schoolboy.</p>
<p>Knowing that we could talk freely together in
our howdah, we three began to discuss earnestly
the desertion of Doctor Gaylord and its bearing
upon our fortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what scared him out,&rdquo; said
Archie. &ldquo;Doc wanted the money and the treasure
as badly as any of us, and his ten thousand taels
was a sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was all right until he met that English
friend at Ichang,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I believe he must
have heard something from him about Mai Lo
or the country between here and Kai-Nong that
took away his courage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; remarked Joe, thoughtfully, &ldquo;Mai
Lo himself has been talking to Doctor Gaylord,
and warned him not to go farther. You see,
Mai Lo knew all along about the imposture we
practiced in regard to the body of the Prince,
and it may be that when the doctor found that
his trick was discovered he thought it time to
dig out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery,&rdquo; I said, soberly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
rather sorry to lose the doctor. He had a pretty
level head usually, and would have been a great
help to us when we got to Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get there, do you think?&rdquo; asked
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the jig was up when Mai Lo discovered
there was a dummy in the casket, instead
of the body of Prince Kai,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Mai Lo was so dead set against our
tossing the body overboard while we were at
sea. He would have defended it with his life,
then. Why does he take the discovery so quietly
now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;The explanation is very simple,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;Chinese customs are peculiar; and especially
those that relate to ancestor worship. Should
Mai Lo return to Kai-Nong without the body of
his dead prince he would be eternally disgraced,
and unless he at once committed suicide he would
be killed by the other servants of the Prince.
So it was a matter of life or death to him whether
we tossed the body overboard or preserved it
and brought it to China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we really did toss it overboard; and Mai
Lo knows it now,&rdquo; objected Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no one else knows it,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;It
was brought to Woosung and passed by the inspector
as the mortal remains of Prince Kai. The
Shanghai papers reported the arrival of the body
of the Prince, in the care of his faithful servant,
the noble governor, Mai Lo, and also gave an
account of the accident that caused his death.
So now all China knows that Mai Lo did his
duty, and is escorting the remains of his master
to the ancestral halls at Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Joe, nodding. &ldquo;The secret is
between Mai Lo and ourselves. That is why
he frightened the doctor away, and tried to prevent
us from continuing the journey to Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Mai Lo has been
saved&mdash;for a time, anyhow&mdash;from committing
suicide, by the very trick we played to deceive
him. Perhaps he saw through our game from
the beginning; I do not know. But we played
into his hands, and so he let us go on. Now there
is no further danger, for he knows we dare not
betray the imposture and it will be easy for him
to place the supposed body in the ancestral halls
without its being examined by anyone. Yet he
preferred not to have us with him when he should
reach Prince Kai&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this knowledge is a protection to us, anyhow,&rdquo;
observed Joe. &ldquo;Mai Lo is sharp enough to
know that if he plays us any tricks we will explode
the whole deception.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;That idea is doubtless influencing him, even
now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What we have to fear is not open
warfare, but trickery and secret assassination.
I don&rsquo;t know how powerful the letter and ring
of Prince Kai will be in his own province, of
which Mai Lo is governor; but the Prince
seemed to think they would command obedience.
Time will have to determine that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you mean by saying that Mai Lo
would be saved from suicide for a time?&rdquo; asked
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, according to the rules and regulations
of ancestor worship, he&rsquo;s got to commit suicide in
a short time, and there&rsquo;s no way of getting out
of it&mdash;except to disappear from China forever.
The Prince was the last of his royal line, and
left no heir; so the rules oblige his chief representative
to seal up his ancestral halls and destroy
all traces of them, so that they will never be disturbed
until the resurrection. Before doing this,
Mai Lo must convert one-half the fortune of
Prince Kai into gold, silver and jewels, and deposit
the treasure beside his coffin. When all
this is accomplished&mdash;and it will require a little
time, although it must be done speedily&mdash;Mai Lo
must commit suicide, in order that the secret of
the entrance to the ancestral vaults shall perish
from the knowledge of men. If he fails to kill
himself, the other servants will kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Joe, slowly, &ldquo;it was discovered
that we shared the knowledge of the entrance
to Prince Kai&rsquo;s ancestral halls; what would happen
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would surely kill us,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But
the secret entrance of which the Prince informed
me is unknown to any of his people&mdash;even to
Mai Lo. I do not fear discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you fear?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear for our personal safety while we remain
in Kai-Nong, and I am not sure that we can
find a way to remove the treasure to Shanghai,
once we have secured it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But we
have known all along that there would be risks
to run, and there&rsquo;s no need crossing these bridges
until we come to them. Prince Kai said it would
be a question of wit and courage; but he predicted
that we would win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we shall!&rdquo; declared Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked Joe, easily. &ldquo;Prince
Kai ought to have known what he was talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ELEPHANT TRAIN.</span></h2>
<p>That overland journey of more than eight
hundred miles by elephant train is well worth
describing, yet it has so little real bearing upon
this story that I shall pass it over as briefly as
possible.</p>
<p>In spite of our fears, Mai Lo treated us with
great respect during this journey, and the escort
showed us the same consideration that they did
the mandarin.</p>
<p>Elephant riding isn&rsquo;t at all disagreeable when
you get used to the swaying motion, and as we
were sailors we quickly accustomed ourselves to
the amble of the big beasts. But to ride day
after day is decidedly tedious, and we were glad
whenever a halt was called and we could stretch
our legs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>During the first stage of our journey, which
was through a densely settled country, we made
little more than thirty miles a day. But when
we reached Min-Kwa, which is on a shallow tributary
of the Yang-tse, we exchanged our elephants
for horses&mdash;fine, spirited beasts&mdash;which
enabled us to make much better time.</p>
<p>We now headed directly northwest, on a beeline
from the Himalayas, and I noticed that as we
proceeded not only the character of the country
but that of the people changed. The placid, indifferent
countenances of the peasants were replaced
by darker, fiercer features; for here were
the descendants of the Tartar horde that once
over-ran and conquered the Chinese. Also the
women, instead of being small and insignificant
in appearance, and mild and docile in character,
were handsome, powerful creatures whose every
action displayed energy and grace. I could not
help admiring them, although their glances denoted
bitter hatred of the foreigners&mdash;a feeling
common throughout the Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The broad, smooth road&mdash;a magnificent thoroughfare,
that would shame the best of our
American boulevards&mdash;sometimes lay through
dense forests of splendid trees, and again twined
its way amid groves of bamboo; but usually we
passed through fields that were under cultivation.
It surprised me to observe the perfection of utility
that pervaded the country on every hand, until
I remembered that here was the most ancient
civilization in the world. There were no waste
places; the numerous population demanded that
every acre be cultivated. Stately walls of excellent
construction are used to divide the land, instead
of the frail fences we set up, and the bridges
over dry streams or gullies would excite the envy
and admiration of our modern engineers. All the
land required irrigation, and Mai Lo informed
me during one of our conversations that the system
of irrigation now employed dated back more
than two thousand years, and was still so satisfactory
that it could not be improved upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When America adopts our plan,&rdquo; said the
mandarin, &ldquo;irrigation will be a success there; but
not before. I have seen your methods, and they
are very imperfect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Chinese fruits were plentiful and cheap. Six
big, delicious pears could be purchased for one
cash&mdash;about one-tenth of a cent; and bunches
of finger-shaped grapes as big as one&rsquo;s head we
bought for two cash. Mai Lo kept us well supplied
with fruit, and indeed we fared luxuriously
throughout the entire journey. Always at night
the mandarin selected a native house and turned
the inhabitants out that we might use it for our
own accommodation. I suppose his authority as
a governor allowed him to do such arbitrary
things, for even the fierce Tartars humbly submitted
to his will. Sometimes we passed the
night at villages, where there may be always
found comfortable inns; but wherever we slept
Nux and Bryonia by turns guarded the slumbers
of us three Americans, while the withered little
imp of a Chinaman who rode with Mai Lo upon
his elephant performed the duty of guarding the
mandarin. Mai Lo seemed to trust us as little
as we trusted him, yet we all realized it would
be folly to come to open warfare at this time.</p>
<p>If anything happened to us, it would not be
until we were at Kai-Nong; we were quite sure
of that. So, for the present we slept as placidly
as if on board our own beautiful <i>Seagull</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Only one disagreeable incident occurred in this
portion of our journey. Sometimes, when we
camped early, our native escort amused themselves
with games; perhaps to restore their circulation
after long periods of riding. The most
popular of these games was one called &ldquo;shipsu.&rdquo;
In playing it two men had to grasp tightly a
short bamboo rod with both hands and then try
to throw one another without releasing hold of
the bamboo. Any trick was allowable in this
novel wrestling-match except taking the hands
from the bamboo, and it was therefore a rough-and-tumble
in which strength and skill were required.
Usually our men played shipsu among
themselves, but one evening in an inn yard where
we were all watching the game, surrounded by a
throng of villagers, a sturdy Manchu offered to
cope with one of Mai Lo&rsquo;s men and the challenge
was accepted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The struggle was long and interesting, and
the combatants jostled the bystanders by abrupt
turns and side leaps. Finally the Manchu hurled
his antagonist to the ground, causing him to release
his hold of the rod. With a shout of victory
the Manchu whirled the rod above his head and
then, happening to find himself near Bryonia,
our tall South Sea Islander, who had been silently
looking on, the fellow struck him a deliberate
blow upon his head. Bry&rsquo;s fist shot out and the
Manchu went sprawling upon the ground, while
a roar of rage went up from the bystanders.
Knives glistened all around us and our Chinese
escort promptly surrounded our little party and
faced the natives expectantly. But Mai Lo waived
his hand, and to my astonishment the escort
melted away and left our black to face his enraged
enemies alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that, Mai Lo?&rdquo; I demanded,
angrily, while the natives, perhaps suspecting
some trick, hesitated to attack Bry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man has committed a crime; he must
die, and perhaps the other black will die with
him,&rdquo; replied the governor, calmly.</p>
<p>While I stood dumfounded at this assertion I
heard Joe say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Mai Lo. Archie is behind you
with his revolver pointed at your head. If anyone
lays hands upon our black it will be the
signal for your own death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo did not look around. He did not
shrink or pale or display fear. But he promptly
waved his hand again and the escort once more
closed around us.</p>
<p>Then the governor addressed the crowd in
Chinese, and talked volubly for a long time.
In a language where it requires two hundred syllables
to say &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; it is probable that
Mai Lo&rsquo;s address was brief and to the point;
anyhow, the sullen crowd melted away and left
us alone, and soon after we entered the inn and
went to bed.</p>
<p>The incident was not referred to again on either
side, but it proved to us how readily the governor
was prepared to sacrifice any members of our
party, and so weaken our numbers, and it warned
us to be constantly upon our guard. I did not
doubt but that Mai Lo had some plan in mind to
circumvent us when we got to Kai-Nong, and
doubtless he was confident of success; but we
refused to be panic-stricken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we were in the dragon&rsquo;s jaws,&rdquo;
remarked Archie, one day, with a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; replied Joe, &ldquo;if we can
keep the dragon from biting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. But sometimes it looks dubious to
me. We&rsquo;re about fifteen hundred miles in the
enemy&rsquo;s country, and the world has lost all track
of us. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, what?&rdquo; I asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the noble physician was wise, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Archie. What&rsquo;s the use of crying
before you&rsquo;re hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my only chance,&rdquo; said he, with a grin.
&ldquo;If Mai Lo gets his work in, I shan&rsquo;t be able to
howl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CHIEF EUNUCH.</span></h2>
<p>About the middle of the seventeenth day we
passed through a dark and gloomy teak forest
and came to a place where two stone towers stood,
one on either side of our road. Just behind these
towers some fifty tents were pitched, and a herd
of elephants and horses were browsing near them.
The tents bore streamers with the Sacred Ape
of Kai embroidered upon them, and a throng
of natives in gay costumes stood in a group
awaiting us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I called to Mai Lo, whose elephant
was ambling close behind our own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These pillars,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mark the boundary
of Kwang-Kai-Nong. When we pass them I
shall be in my own territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and are these your people?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have sent messengers ahead to warn
them of my coming. So they are here to receive
the body of their prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we continued to advance the group stood
motionless, and I had leisure to examine them.
They were finely formed fellows, tall and athletic,
and many of them wore beards, some jet black,
some gray, some snow white. It was easy to see
that this reception committee was composed of
the best element of the Kaitos, probably most of
them nobles and holding important offices in the
principality.</p>
<p>The mahout in charge of the elephant which
bore the casket of the Prince now urged his beast
slightly in advance of our party, and, as it passed
the gateway marked by the towering pillars, the
members of the group prostrated themselves and
with loud wails and groans grabbed up the dust
from the road and scattered it over their bowed
heads and bodies, until they were a sight to behold.
Then they raised themselves to their knees,
extended their arms skyward, and howled in concert
like so many coyotes. The din was ear-splitting,
and while it continued Mai Lo descended
from his elephant and groveled with the
others in the dust before the casket of Prince Kai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Then two aged Kaitos advanced and raised the
governor, and escorted him to a tent. The others
continued their cries until the casket had
been lifted from the elephant and conveyed into
another tent&mdash;the largest and most decorated one
of the encampment.</p>
<p>During this time we had remained unnoted observers
of the scene; but when the casket disappeared
behind the walls of the tent the people,
having risen and dusted themselves, began to
look upon us with curiosity. Nux and Bryonia,
who had dismounted with the casket and stood
like ebony statues beside the elephant, attracted
most of the scrutiny, but bore the ordeal with
much dignity.</p>
<p>I was pleased to observe in these people a lack
of that ferocious hatred that had marked the
countenances of most of the Chinese we had encountered.
These men seemed more curious
than antagonistic. When we boys dismounted
and stood among them they all inclined their
bodies in more or less lowly obeisance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Probably the messengers sent forward by Mai
Lo had described us to these people as the friends
of the late Prince, for they seemed not surprised
to find us with the governor&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>The tent in which lay the casket of the Prince
was at once surrounded by a cordon of guards,
armed with scimitars shaped like those of the
ancient Saracens. But no one entered the tent
itself.</p>
<p>The principal members of the reception party
followed Mai Lo into his tent, while others ushered
us into still another tent, in which we found
couches spread, and low tables before them bearing
refreshments of tea and cakes. Here we remained
all the afternoon. Nux and Bryonia
stood guard outside the entrance, stolidly bearing
the gaze of the natives.</p>
<p>When the sun went down there was another
period of wailing throughout the camp; but the
noise soon ceased. Shortly afterward one of
our escort, who understood a few words of English,
came to us with an invitation to join &ldquo;the
noble governor and the great Wi-to&rdquo; at the
evening banquet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>I inquired who the &ldquo;great Wi-to&rdquo; might be,
and was told that he was the Chief Eunuch and
Supreme Ruler of the palace of Prince Kai, and
the most important personage, in short, in Kwang-Kai-Nong
after the illustrious governor.</p>
<p>When we entered the banquet tent we found
about twenty of the most important Kaitos assembled.
A circle of low wicker tables stood in
the center of the tent, with rugs spread before
them. At one side, in the center of a small group,
stood Mai Lo, arrayed in splendid costume, and
beside him stood a slender, stooping individual
with a smooth shaven face, whose magnificent
robes caused even those of the governor to appear
plain. Around his neck was a chain of superb
rubies. When Mai Lo, in a pompous and somewhat
haughty tone, presented us to Wi-to, the
Chief Eunuch gave us a whimsical look and raised
a pair of bright, intelligent eyes to meet our own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;The strangers are welcome,&rdquo; he said in a low,
soft tone&mdash;the first speech I had heard from a
Chinaman that was not harsh and rasping since
my conversation with Prince Kai. His English
was not so perfect as that of the Prince, but much
smoother than Mai Lo&rsquo;s, and it gave me a sense
of relief to find another English-speaking personage
in this far-off country.</p>
<p>My notion of eunuchs had been that they were
fierce creatures of powerful build, usually Ethiopians,
and greatly to be feared. I had heard
tales of their absolute power in the palaces of the
nobles, and that even the mighty Empress Tsi
An had failed to curb the influence of her palace
eunuchs. So it pleased me to find Wi-to more
agreeable in manner and speech than the imperturbable
governor, and I answered him as pleasantly
as I could, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come on a sad mission, your Highness;
to escort the remains of your master and
our beloved friend to his old home. Had the
Prince not requested us to come here, we should
not have ventured to intrude upon you at this
unhappy moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know whether it was proper to address
the Chief Eunuch as &ldquo;your Highness&rdquo; or
not; but perhaps the compliment pleased him,
for he smiled, then screwed up his face into a
semblance of grief, then smiled again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are deeply grieved and inconsolable,&rdquo;
said he, cheerfully. &ldquo;The illustrious and royal
Prince Kai, whose memory I serve as faithfully
as I did his person, has lived at Kai-Nong but
little since he was a boy, and we had hoped that
upon his return he would command the affairs of
his province and become a mighty Viceroy of the
Celestial and August Emperor. But he has
passed on to a greater Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo now summoned us to the feast in a
voice that I thought a trifle impatient; but the
eunuch paid no attention. He was examining
Archie as he had me, and asked him how he liked
China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be impolite,&rdquo; said the bluff
Archie, &ldquo;and perhaps this country is all right for
the people who live here; but for my part I
prefer America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is natural,&rdquo; returned Wi, laughing;
&ldquo;and curiously enough, Prince Kai had the same
idea, or rather he preferred any part of Europe
to his old home. Did my duties permit, I too
would travel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Mai Lo called again, and the eunuch turned
and nodded. Then he said to Joe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the journey has not tired the friend of
my Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as fresh as a daisy,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;But I can
hardly call the Prince my friend, although I
knew and liked him. Sam, here, was the especial
friend of Prince Kai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what the shrewd eunuch had wanted
to find out. He turned good-naturedly toward
the governor and asked his pardon for the delay,
in English.</p>
<p>When we seated ourselves upon the rugs, I
found that I was at the right hand of the Chief
Eunuch and Joe at his left. Archie sat next me,
and far away on the other side squatted Mai Lo,
with dignified Kaitos on either side of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The meal was excellently prepared and served,
though I had no idea of what the dishes consisted.
Wi-to plied me with questions concerning
the death of the Prince and the details of his
accident. I gave him the story as clearly as I
could, and our conversation, held in low tones,
did not interrupt the chatter in Chinese going on
around us. I asked Wi-to where he learned to
speak English, and he said that Prince Kai had
taught him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an excellent language to converse in, and
easier than our own,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for it is much
more simple. And when my Prince and I talked
together no listeners could understand what he
said. That is a great convenience in palace life,
I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two things of importance impressed themselves
upon me during this interview. One was the fact
that the Chief Eunuch was not afraid of Mai Lo,
and was rather inclined to snub the governor,
and the other that Wi-to seemed disposed to be
friendly toward us.</p>
<p>Joe observed another fact that escaped me, and
that was the evident disfavor with which all the
nobles present regarded the eunuch. They
treated him with great respect, but shunned his
society, and Joe declared that we had forfeited
the general regard by hobnobbing with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>This was disconcerting, at first, but when I
came to think it over I decided that it was best
for us to be on a friendly footing with Wi-to,
whatever the others might think of us. For he
was in command of the palace, and the palace
was to be the scene of our adventures. Mai Lo
we knew to be opposed to us, and therefore a
friend such as the Chief Eunuch was not to be
despised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>After the feast, which lasted far into the night,
we all went out and joined the throng which had
congregated before the tent where the supposed
body of Prince Kai lay in state. There an interesting
ceremony was performed. First there was
much wailing, grief being expressed in childish
&ldquo;boo-hoos&rdquo; accompanied by the clang of cymbals
and gongs. The uproar was deafening for a
time, but gradually subsided. Then the people
advanced one by one to the entrance of the tent
and there burned papers cut into queer shapes.
These papers represented the things Prince Kai
might need while his spirit was wandering in the
land of the Genii, and consisted of chairs, tables,
chests, wearing apparel, jewelry, nuts, fruit and
the like. Many sheets of gold and silver tinsel
were likewise burned, the idea being to supply
the Prince with wealth to purchase whatever he
might need in the mysterious country to which
he had gone.</p>
<p>The ceremony was interesting, as I said; but
it grew tedious, and we were glad when it was
over and we were permitted to retire to our tent
for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ROYAL HOUSE OF KAI.</span></h2>
<p>Early next morning the procession was formed
for the journey to Kai-Nong, the capital city of
the province.</p>
<p>The casket of the Prince was loaded upon a
magnificent elephant, which was caparisoned
from head to foot with silken streamers and bunting
of gorgeous colors. No one now rode beside
the casket, but a guard of three score warriors,
each with the emblem of the Sacred Ape
embroidered upon the breast of his tunic, formed
a cordon around the elephant and marched
solemnly beside it.</p>
<p>Following the royal elephant came that of the
governor, Mai Lo, and then five elephants bearing
the most important nobles. After these
came our own elephant, and behind it that of
Wi-to, the Chief Eunuch. A troop of horsemen,
good riders and martial looking fellows, followed
in our wake, and in the rear were our former
escort and the baggage animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Before the royal elephant and its guards was a
motley crowd of natives beating gongs, clashing
cymbals and wailing their nerve-racking &ldquo;boo-hoos.&rdquo;
As we proceeded, men left their fields
and gardens and the wayside houses and joined
these mourners, so that by noon there was a
black mob ahead of us for a quarter of a mile,
all wailing and making as much noise as
they could&mdash;which I assure you was considerable.</p>
<p>I was glad to be in the rear and as far away
from the mourners as possible, and it was with
great relief that I saw before us, as we mounted
a slight eminence, the white walls of a great city.
Behind it towered the nearest peaks of the Himalayas,
still many miles distant, and the scene was
picturesque and impressive.</p>
<p>Another hour&rsquo;s riding brought us to the gates
of the city, and here the mob halted and redoubled
its clamor while we all passed through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>But now we found fresh crowds of the citizens
awaiting us with tom-toms, cymbals and gongs,
and these caught up the wails of those outside
and made more noise than ever. The streets
through which we passed were broad and smooth,
and lined with substantial dwellings of stone.
On either side of the streets, as we passed, were
rows of prostrate forms scattering dust upon
their heads as evidence of grief for the death of
their prince. The bazaars were closed and the
entire city of Kai-Nong seemed in mourning. We
afterward learned that the capital contains three
hundred thousand inhabitants, and is one of the
most prosperous cities of northwestern China.</p>
<p>We had ridden fully a half hour through the
streets, our ears saluted every instant with the
deafening and discordant notes of grief, when at
last we reached a vast garden surrounded by a
high wall.</p>
<p>Here we halted, being confronted by a group
of officials headed by the Fuh-yin, or mayor of
the city. He evidently delivered an oration of
much power, judging from its length and the
groans from our party which interspersed it. At
its conclusion Mai Lo made a brief reply from
his seat on the elephant. At the end of this the
Fuh-yin and his officials prostrated themselves
while the royal elephant bore the casket through
a huge ornamental gateway into the gardens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>And now, to my surprise, the elephant of the
Chief Eunuch pressed forward and that officer
took the position of honor in the procession&mdash;immediately
following the casket. The guards, too,
fell away and remained outside the walls, while
only the elephant of Mai Lo and our own were
permitted to pass the gateway.</p>
<p>But once inside the gardens we saw that a new
escort had been provided for the royal remains.
Sixty gorgeously appareled men, armed with
scimitars and broad axes, formed a circle around
the elephant that bore the casket and prepared to
guard it. They were stalwart, erect fellows, of
proud bearing but evil and ferocious countenances,
and each wore a yellow turban coiled
upon his head, with a golden clasp, in effigy of
the Sacred Ape, fastening the folds just above
the forehead.</p>
<p>These were the eunuchs, the palace guards, or
servants and attendants of the harem. For now
we were within the palace grounds, and Wi-to
had assumed command of the procession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The wailing and clamor died away to a faint
murmur behind us as we wound in and out by
intricate paths between stately trees and beside
beds of brilliant flowers; but from afar at moments
we still heard the sounds of grief, which
were continued in the city until midnight.</p>
<p>The gardens were of astonishing extent and
were artistically planned and carefully tended.
The trees and shrubbery were thick in places.
We emerged from their shade to find beautiful
gardens of flowers surrounding us. Once in a
while I caught glimpses of the buildings, which
seemed very ornate and constructed mainly of
teak, mahogany and dressed stone, all with tiled
roofs, curved and serrated.</p>
<p>At last we deployed into a broad space at the
foot of a green mound, upon which stood the
palace and outbuildings, rambling structures so
numerous and extensive that they presented
almost the appearance of a village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>The main building was a splendid one. Polished
stone formed the walls, and blue tiles the
many gabled, turreted and curved intricacies of
the roof. Carved teakwood covered the face of
the stone in many places. At the great portico
of the entrance the carving was elaborate almost
beyond relief.</p>
<p>From the mound to the broad space where we
had halted were terraces with many steps leading
up to the palace, and at intervals on these steps
were urns of graceful design, statues of wood and
bronze and lamps of artistic ironwork.</p>
<p>We all dismounted here, and the mahouts led
away the elephants. Some of the eunuchs bore
the casket of the Prince up the broad steps of
the terrace, while Wi-to bowed low, first to the
Governor and then to us, and welcomed us to the
Royal House of Kai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GOVERNOR SHOWS HIS TEETH.</span></h2>
<p>Followed by Nux and Bryonia, who never
relaxed their vigilance over us, we three boys
attended the governor and the Chief Eunuch to
the entrance of the palace&mdash;the first foreigners
to step foot in this retired stronghold of an ancient
race.</p>
<p>At the carved portico Mai Lo turned and regarded
us intently, and then began a long lingo
in Chinese to which the eunuch listened carefully.</p>
<p>The casket had disappeared through the entrance;
the army of eunuchs had melted away and
disappeared; we seemed quite alone with these
two natives, one of whom we knew distrusted
and hated us.</p>
<p>The result of the conversation was that we
were shown into a broad, lofty hall just within
the entrance and asked to seat ourselves until
rooms could be prepared for our accommodation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The Chief Eunuch, who made this request,
looked at us shrewdly and with an expression
more grave and reserved than he had yet shown
us, and then turned and entered a side room in
company with the governor.</p>
<p>We were much annoyed at this discourteous
treatment. It was now the middle of the afternoon,
and we had eaten nothing since breakfast,
at daybreak. Wi-to certainly should have given
us some food before leaving us to sit in the hall
awaiting his convenience. The pretence of preparing
rooms for us was absurd. With such an
army of servants the palace should have been,
and doubtless was, perfectly appointed. But here
we were, seated upon stiff carved sofas in the
great hall of the palace, and here we must remain
until it suited Mai Lo and the eunuch to relieve
us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The magnificence of the palace aroused our
admiration in spite of our annoyance. The floor
was tiled and covered here and there with costly
rugs; the woodwork everywhere was elaborately
carved, and every nook and corner was crowded
with rare ornaments and bric-&agrave;-brac, art treasures
which would have filled the soul of a collector
with envy. On one face of the wall was
a display of ancient armor and weapons inlaid
with gold and silver and set with precious gems.
At either side of the entrance stood a huge bronze
figure of the Sacred Ape, its grinning jaws filled
with ivory teeth and its eyes set with immense
rubies.</p>
<p>We had ample leisure to look around us, for no
one came to our relief during the next hour.
Also we had time to discuss our situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it all means, boys?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if they had allowed us to come this
far so that they might murder us,&rdquo; answered
Archie, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo must have said something to the
Chief Eunuch that turned him against us,&rdquo;
remarked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but if I get a chance
I intend to put a spoke in Mai Lo&rsquo;s wheel. We&rsquo;ve
got to win the good will of the eunuch or we&rsquo;re
done for. He seems to have unlimited power in
the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mai Lo has said anything about
the&mdash;the body?&rdquo; whispered Archie, glancing suspiciously
around. &ldquo;Speak low, fellows; we don&rsquo;t
know how many ears may be listening behind
that carving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure Mai Lo won&rsquo;t betray his own
secret,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He has probably warned the
eunuch not to trust us, as we might steal the
whole palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe had started to reply when a door opened
and Mai Lo entered the hall and approached us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we kept here waiting?&rdquo; I demanded,
trying to control my temper. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand
such treatment, Mai Lo, I assure you. We must
be treated with proper respect or something
unpleasant is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave words,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have deeds to back them,&rdquo; retorted
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll force us to ruin if you&rsquo;re not careful,
Gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; added Archie, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, as if the idea had just occurred
to me; &ldquo;if you think to play us false, Mai Lo, it
will cost you your life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>He turned his glassy eyes from one to the
other of us, and when I had finished he asked,
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you make a compact with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one already,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;deposited
at the American consul&rsquo;s office, at Shanghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is so far away,&rdquo; he said significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise not to talk about what has
occurred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you promise in return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To send you safely back to Shanghai at
once&mdash;tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to remain here some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot remain here alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;If that is your game
I will expose you now&mdash;to the Chief Eunuch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not see him again,&rdquo; said Mai Lo,
slowly, &ldquo;unless you promise to return at once to
Shanghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the guests of your Prince for a full
year, if we care to remain. Dare you oppose
your Prince&rsquo;s orders?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am now the supreme power in this principality,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>I turned to my comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, boys?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give in,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fight it out,&rdquo; observed Joe, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your lives shall be the forfeit,&rdquo; announced
Mai Lo, and before we could stop him he
blew a shrill blast upon a little silver whistle that
hung around his neck.</p>
<p>But I saw the action and motioned to Nux and
Bry. Instantly my blacks had pounced upon the
governor and drawn him behind us, holding him
secure, while from a dozen nooks about the hall
sprang eunuchs with drawn scimitars, who ran
swiftly toward us.</p>
<p>As the foremost approached I stepped forward
and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They knew no English, but they comprehended
the action, and paused irresolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order them away, Mai Lo,&rdquo; growled Archie.
&ldquo;Quick, you yellow monkey, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet
through your head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Archie,&rdquo; I called, still facing the
eunuchs. Then I showed them the ring of Prince
Kai and said sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wi-to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They understood at a glance, and lowering
their weapons, bowed humbly before me. Then
one of them ran up the hall and disappeared,
while we stood motionless in our places. Mai
Lo was held fast by the blacks, Archie and Joe
stood behind me with drawn revolvers and I
faced the band of eunuchs.</p>
<p>Wi-to suddenly entered and came hastily
toward us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he asked,
taking in the scene at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo has been hasty and summoned your
men by mistake,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He wishes you
to send them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wi looked at the captive governor, who stood
motionless with Archie&rsquo;s revolver pointed directly
at his left ear, and then the eunuch smiled as if
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true, most noble Governor?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered Mai Lo, calmly.</p>
<p>Then Wi laughed outright and clapped his
hands. The men disappeared as if by magic.</p>
<p>At a signal from me the blacks released Mai
Lo, who deliberately rearranged his clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a personal conversation with you,
Wi-to,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but first of all we want something
to eat, and proper entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not the slaves of Mai Lo?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we are his masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I showed the ring of Prince Kai, and the
effect was to send the Chief Eunuch to his knees
before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the friends and representatives of
your dead master,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;and are here to
carry out his orders. Mai Lo knows this perfectly
well, for Prince Kai ordered him to obey
me as he would his royal master, and he himself
witnessed with his signature the authority I bear.
But he does not seem inclined to respect this
order for some reason of his own; so I appeal to
you to protect and assist us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eunuch rose and bowed gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your orders shall be obeyed,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; interrupted a harsh voice from the
governor. &ldquo;The ring was stolen from me on the
journey here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can disprove that statement,&rdquo; said I, easily,
&ldquo;and I am surprised that Mai Lo, who is so soon
to commit suicide, would dare to speak falsely.
Give us some food, Wi-to, and then we can talk
further of this matter. But I won&rsquo;t have the
governor present at the interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eunuch nodded and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, if you please,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WI-TO PROVES FAITHFUL.</span></h2>
<p>After being profusely fed we were ready for
an important interview with Wi-to; an interview
that was to determine our standing in the Royal
House of Kai.</p>
<p>The governor had left us in the hall and we
had not seen him since; but as it was now to be
open warfare between us we did not care what
his future intentions might be.</p>
<p>The Chief Eunuch had forborne to question us
while we ate, and appeared unusually thoughtful;
but when we rose he ushered us into a little room
on the main floor which seemed to be his private
office. It was luxuriously furnished and we were
given comfortable chairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Nux and Bryonia accompanied us here, as they
did everywhere; but Wi-to seemed to disregard
the precaution of having any of his own men
present at the interview.</p>
<p>He offered us cigars, and when we refused he
lighted one himself and leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What proof have you that the ring of Prince
Kai was not stolen?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>For answer I took the Prince&rsquo;s letter of authority
from my pocketbook and handed it to him
to read.</p>
<p>He perused it carefully and with a grave countenance;
then folded the paper, pressed it to his
forehead and returned it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince is my master, whether he is here
in the flesh or wandering in the land of the
Genii,&rdquo; said the eunuch. &ldquo;He has given to you,
Sam Steele, the power to command his servants,
and I, as one of the most faithful of these, will
obey you, even for the term of one year. But
much has happened since my noble master died,
and Mai Lo has told me strange things about
you, which, if true, would annul even the authority
of the great Prince Kai. Let us talk
together; tell me all that I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard how the Prince was injured,
and how we brought him to our ship and cared
for him until he died,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, before Prince Kai died, there were certain
matters he wished to attend to. At his palace
in Kai-Nong were some possessions he wanted
taken to England and America and given to
friends in those countries, that they might cherish
his memory. There were some papers in his
yamen here that he wished to destroy, that no
eyes might read them. There were some of his
servants here that he wished to reward for faithful
service. All this he asked me and my two
friends to do for him, in his name and by his
authority; and we promised Prince Kai Lun Pu
it should be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eunuch had listened carefully, and I had
tried to be as direct in speech as I could, realizing
that to make any blunder at this time would prove
fatal to our plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did not the Prince ask his governor to
do all this? Has not Mai Lo been a faithful
servant and followed his master to the ends of the
earth?&rdquo; asked Wi-to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince was very wise,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was very wise,&rdquo; repeated Wi-to, nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had traveled far and learned many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also he had learned how to read men&rsquo;s hearts,
and he saw that the heart of Mai Lo had changed
since he had mixed with foreign people, and become
acquainted with foreign ways. Therefore
the Prince no longer trusted Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Mai Lo has been faithful and brought
the body of his master many thousand li, that it
may rest in peace in the halls of his ancestors,&rdquo;
remarked Wi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; I acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the governor wished to be faithless he
could have remained in foreign lands and so preserved
his life. By returning here he is forced,
as soon as his affairs and those of his Prince are
arranged, to kill himself&mdash;or be killed,&rdquo; said the
eunuch, thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has done all this,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and Prince
Kai, who distrusted him, expected him to act in
this way. For the governor is very crafty and
full of tricks. To remain abroad would make
him a poor man. Mai Lo wants to be rich, and
to pass his life in Europe, with many slaves and
all the luxuries of the Western civilization. So
Prince Kai said to me that the governor would
come back to Kai-Nong, to get much treasure and
with it flee from this empire to Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wi-to seemed genuinely astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where could Mai Lo get such treasure?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His duty is to convert all the fortune of
Prince Kai into cash and deposit it in the ancestral
chih, or tombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eunuch laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Kai has squandered all his fortune,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Outside of what his palace contains
there is little or nothing to convert into cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I own I was astonished at this statement, but
I tried not to show it, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among other duties, Mai Lo is to seal up
the ancestral chih, and destroy all traces of its
existence. Listen now, Wi-to, for this is the
important thing that was in the mind of Prince
Kai; he declared to me that Mai Lo would rob
his ancestral halls of the great treasures deposited
there during the past ages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; gasped the eunuch, staring at me
in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo is no Shintoist,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;His
travels have made him a renegade and taught
him to despise the religion of his ancestors. He
has no intention of committing suicide, according
to the traditions of your people. Nor will he
allow the vast treasures of the House of Kai to
remain sealed up in the burial halls when he has
the power to enrich himself with them. His
power as governor of this province will enable
him to make secret arrangements to fly to Shanghai
or Hong-Kong, and from there to leave
China forever and carry his stolen wealth with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eunuch arose and paced the floor thoughtfully.
He was much agitated at what I had said
and was pondering my words carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no faith in Mai Lo, yourself,&rdquo; I
suggested, watching him closely. &ldquo;You know in
your heart he is treacherous and false, just as
the noble Prince knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Suddenly he sat down and his brow cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why Prince Kai employed comparative
strangers to do his bidding,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;We
had not known him long, but he believed he could
trust us, and so he gave me his letter of authority
and his ring, that we might receive the support
of his faithful servants in the tasks we have
undertaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think I will side with you against
the powerful governor?&rdquo; asked the Chief Eunuch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will; and the Prince was sure,&rdquo;
I answered, confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can destroy you foreigners with a word,
and sweep you from my path. Then I can make
an alliance with Mai Lo and together we could
rob the ancestral halls and escape to some other
country to enjoy the wealth. Yes, yes! It is a
pretty plan, and we could do it easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will not,&rdquo; said Joe, while I stared
aghast at the eunuch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked, turning to the boy with
a curious expression upon his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; replied Joe, &ldquo;you are a
faithful and true servant, or Prince Kai, who
knew men&rsquo;s hearts, would not have made you his
Chief Eunuch. From what I have seen of your
followers I believe you are the only gentleman of
the whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also am a eunuch,&rdquo; said Wi. &ldquo;I am of
lowly birth, and as a child my parents sold me
to the House of Kai to become a eunuch. My
consent was not asked. Why should I be faithful
to my masters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your nature,&rdquo; asserted Joe. &ldquo;I said you
were a gentleman, and so you are, as we Americans
accept the word. With us a gentleman is he
who behaves as a gentleman should; not a person
highly born. But there is still another reason.
A eunuch is of no use in the world outside of his
own province. Here you have power. In Europe
you would be despised and insulted. You don&rsquo;t
know the big outside world, and you would be
unhappy there, in spite of your wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d feel like a fish out of water,&rdquo; added
Archie, nodding.</p>
<p>Wi-to laughed, and the laugh was not forced,
but merry and spontaneous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Again you are right!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My Prince
offered twice to take me away with him to see the
outside world, and I refused&mdash;for the very reasons
you have given. Now I will ask another question.
Why should I not divide the treasure with
Mai Lo and remain here to enjoy it? No one
would know where my wealth came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot answer that,&rdquo; said I, musingly; &ldquo;if
you are faithless enough to do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not faithless,&rdquo; persisted Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are answered, Wi-to,&rdquo; I declared,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see I must answer my own question,&rdquo; said
the eunuch. &ldquo;This estate will become the property
of the Celestial and August Emperor, because
Prince Kai left no heir to inherit it. It
may stand for many years unoccupied, and in that
case I may lead a life of ease and be the real
master here. If the Celestial and August Emperor
should bestow this estate and palace upon
some mandarin or high official, it is the custom
to retain the services of the Chief Eunuch who
has before ruled the household. So, in any event,
I have no incentive to be faithless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow Mai Lo to carry out his plan
to rob the ancestral halls?&rdquo; inquired Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You are right in thinking that the governor
and I are not friends, for he has tried to
interfere with my rights, and that I will allow no
man to do. Outside the palace walls Mai Lo
commands the province of Kwang-Kai-Nong;
within this enclosure my word is law. But he
has one privilege within my domain which I
cannot refuse him. By virtue of his office he is
the sole protector of the chih, or ancestral halls
of the House of Kai. He alone has the right to
enter there, now that the noble Prince Kai has
gone to the Genii. For myself, although I have
guarded the entrance for many years, I have
never seen the interior of the building, nor do I
know the way to the vaults beneath it. But
although Mai Lo may enter the halls he must not
remove any of the treasure that belongs to those
ancestors of the House of Kai that lie buried
there. It will be my business to prevent that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And now, Wi-to, since
you have seen the written instructions of Prince
Kai, how do you intend to treat us who are here
to represent his interests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be honored guests in this palace,&rdquo;
was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you protect us from the governor?&rdquo;
inquired Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you are inside the palace enclosure you
shall be safely guarded from Mai Lo and all other
enemies. But remember my power does not
extend beyond this fu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he clapped his hands together and
two eunuchs stepped forward from behind a
screen, so silently that their appearance startled
me. Speaking rapidly, Wi issued some orders to
his men in Chinese, and then turned again to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the suite of rooms I have placed at your
disposal is not satisfactory,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you may
have your choice of any the palace contains, excepting
only the royal apartments. Your meals
will be served in your own rooms at such hours
as you direct, and whatever you may desire I
shall be prompt to provide. This man,&rdquo; indicating
the taller of the two eunuchs, &ldquo;is instructed
to devote himself to your service. His name is
Tun; he is a Manchu and will be faithful. Tomorrow,
if you desire, I will myself show you
through the palace and the gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thank you, Wi-to,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>And then the eunuchs led the way and we followed
them back into the great hall, up the elaborate
winding stairway and along several passages
until we came to a richly carved door. Tun
opened this and motioned us to enter.</p>
<p>So we went in, followed by Nux and Bryonia;
but the eunuchs remained outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SACRED APES OF KAI.</span></h2>
<p>I am not much acquainted with palaces, but I
venture to state that those of European countries
are not more magnificent, even when inhabited
by royalty, than that of this Manchu prince of
the ancient line of Kai. It is a mistake to think
that the Chinese are half civilized, or wholly
uncivilized, as I myself had carelessly considered
them until I visited their Empire. They boast
a civilization older than any other existent nation;
they were cultured, artistic and learned
thousands of years before the Christian Era, and
while the inventions and clever utilities of our
modern Western civilization give us advantages
in many ways over the Chinese, we cannot withhold
our respect and admiration for the accomplishments
of this ancient and substantial race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Our suite was so luxurious as to astonish us.
It consisted of ten rooms, five being sleeping
rooms furnished in carved teakwood, mahogany
and rosewood. The bedsteads and other furniture
were marvels of intricate carving, and
statues, vases and ornaments were everywhere.
The floors were strewn with costly rugs and the
walls hung with priceless tapestries. We called
it the &ldquo;Kite Suite,&rdquo; because these tapestries bore
many scenes in which kites were flying.</p>
<p>We judged from the parting speech of Wi-to
that we were not expected to leave our apartments
again that day, so we passed the evening in perfecting
our plans of procedure and discussing
ways to further our important undertaking. So
far we had prospered in our adventure as well as
we could possibly expect. Mai Lo had exhibited
considerable foolishness and lack of foresight in
his opposition to us, and we were learning to
despise the mandarin&rsquo;s enmity. But the Chief
Eunuch was more sagacious and discerning, and,
as Prince Kai had warned us, he would have no
hesitation in cutting us down if he discovered us
robbing the ancestral halls of Kai. So we knew
that we must plan shrewdly in order to deceive
Wi-to, and that above all we must retain his confidence
and good will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>We talked long over our plans, but found that
we could not map out a definite program without
knowing more of the palace and its surroundings.
And much must be left to chance and circumstance.</p>
<p>Our meals were served in one of the rooms
of our suite. The food provided was not such as
we were accustomed to at home, but it was deliciously
cooked and seasoned, and many of the
dishes we learned to enjoy with relish. The meal
of that evening will serve as a sample of the
dinners we ate while in Prince Kai&rsquo;s palace:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>First, there was tea&mdash;and last, there was tea.
But the first tea was followed by shark-fin soup,
pigeon-egg stew, bacon fritters with egg batter,
shredded duck, pickled watermelon seeds, fried
mush of almond meal, chicken combs, stewed
mushrooms, almond cream custard, spiced shellfish,
bird&rsquo;s-nest pudding, olives and nuts, chicken
soup, fresh fish boiled and then mashed after the
bones had been removed, snow fungus, brains of
yellow-fish, water lily seeds, some mysterious
sweets, and queer cakes, and then tea. I ought to
say that every course was also a rice course,
because a bowl of rice was placed in front of each
one of us and kept full by the attendants throughout
the meal. Also we were served, between teas,
a sickish sweet wine which was warm and
sparkling, but which none of us could drink.
The Chinese use their fingers a good deal in eating;
and, instead of finger-bowls, the attendants
pass us from time to time towels that had been
dipped in hot water. The funny part of it was
that our only implements were ivory chop-sticks,
and we had much amusement in trying to use
these, until our man Tun perceived our difficulties
and brought us some Syrian spoons, inlaid
with gold, which had probably been purchased
by some Kai as curiosities. With these we made
out very well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The palace seemed to throng with eunuchs.
There had been sixty in the procession, but those
were not all the palace contained. When our
meals were served there was a eunuch to wait
upon each one of us, and a dozen more to carry
in and remove the dishes. These men were invariably
respectful and even humble, but they
were an ill-looking crew, and we were never at
ease in their presence.</p>
<p>As none of Wi&rsquo;s men seemed able to speak
English, except Tun, and he very imperfectly,
the Chief Eunuch himself came to us in the
morning. He asked whether we would like to
examine the palace and grounds. We accepted
the invitation with alacrity.</p>
<p>Proceeding down the passage we turned a circular
elbow where hung a splendid tapestry on
which was represented the Earth Dragon, with its
coils encircling the figure of a woman, who struggled
vainly to escape. The horrible grinning
teeth of the monster were close to her despairing
face, and my heart beat fast as I recognized this
tapestry as the one Prince Kai had told us concealed
the secret door to his sleeping chamber.</p>
<p>Archie and Joe recognized it, too, and I feared
their significant looks might attract the notice of
Wi; but he had no knowledge of the secret himself
and so proceeded calmly along the main
passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Presently we came to an elaborately carved
doorway, above which was an ivory fish, with two
horns upon its head. Before this doorway stood
a sleepy looking eunuch who saluted his chief as
we passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Wi, &ldquo;is the entrance to the Suite
of the Horned Fish, the royal apartments. I am
sorry I cannot allow you to see them, but entrance
is prohibited except to those of the royal line of
Kai. Opposite, however, is the Suite of the Pink
Blossoms, and that is well worth your inspection.&rdquo;
We entered many suites on this upper floor
of the palace, and admired their splendor and
magnificence. Then we descended the great stairway
and inspected the state and family apartments,
the royal dining hall, and many other
rooms, all gorgeous beyond description. The
wealth of bronzes, paintings, ornaments and
tapestries was wonderful, and was doubtless the
accumulation of centuries of cultured and wealthy
princes of Kai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>We passed out at the rear of the palace. A
stately flower-garden filled the space between the
main building and the numerous outbuildings.
All these were located upon the mound, and there
were many handsome trees and curious shrubs to
lend beauty and shade to the scene. The outbuildings
were interesting and consisted of the
storehouses, the artisan&rsquo;s home, the artist&rsquo;s house,
the house of the weavers, the kitchens and the
servants&rsquo; quarters. Also there were several
beautiful summer-houses and retreats, pagoda-shaped
and very cool and inviting.</p>
<p>On the further slope of the mound we observed
an odd-looking pagoda built of stone pillars supporting
a yellow-tiled roof, above which floated
many gay pennants. As we drew near we found
the central part to consist of a circle of stout
brass bars, within which were imprisoned a dozen
or more gigantic apes. The beasts set up a series
of sharp, barking cries as we approached, and when
we stood before the cage they sprang at the bars
and shook them angrily, as if they longed to
escape and tear us to pieces. Never have I beheld
such fierce and horrible beasts as these.
Wi-to, who first made obeisance and then stood
calmly looking at them, explained that they were
the Sacred Apes of the House of Kai, and were
tended with reverent care, having their own
corps of servants to minister to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>They were covered with short gray hairs and
their limbs were remarkably powerful. Their
eyes were bright and fierce, but gleamed with intelligence.
Among them I noticed one enormous
fellow who seemed to dominate the band. He
did not attack the bars as did the others, but
squatted in the center of the cage, with his head
slightly bent forward and his grinning teeth
wickedly displayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the King Ape, Fo-Chu by name,&rdquo;
said Wi, seeing my eyes fixed upon this dreadful
creature. &ldquo;He is very old&mdash;some say a hundred
years&mdash;and his strength equals his age; Fo-Chu
has nine executions to his credit in my own time;
how many he has killed since he came here I
cannot guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were his victims?&rdquo; I asked, with a shudder,
as the cruel eyes of the King Ape chanced to
meet mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;His attendants, usually. But there is a story
of how Kai-Tu-Ghai, the grandfather of our late
Prince, wearying of life because of dissensions in
his harem, opened the door of this cage and shook
hands with Fo-Chu. When they found Kai-Tu-Ghai
he was nothing but shreds, for the King Ape
had lapped up every drop of his blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrible death!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course this added to the importance of
Fo-Chu,&rdquo; continued Wi, with a slight smile, &ldquo;for
he was afterward held more sacred than before,
containing, as he does, the soul of Kai-Tu-Ghai.
That is why he is the King Ape and the most
sacred of all the band, for in him still lives the
spirit of an ancestor of the House of Kai, and it
is believed that Fo-Chu will live to the end of the
world and protect the fortunes of this royal house.
When he kills an attendant we say that Kai-Tu-Ghai
was angry, as it is his privilege to be, and
what is left of the slave is buried with high
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PEARL OF KAI-NONG.</span></h2>
<p>We were glad to turn away from these disgusting
and fearful creatures, and Archie asked
our conductor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a harem connected with the palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Wi; &ldquo;but you are not permitted
to visit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the late Prince many wives?&rdquo; inquired
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had none at all. In the harem lives his
sister, a young girl but sixteen years of age.
Her mother is long since dead, but she has nine
aunts, now well advanced in years, to keep her
company. They were the wives of Kai-Tien, the
father of Prince Kai Lun Pu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was the Prince fond of his sister?&rdquo; I
asked, remembering that he had never mentioned
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;He scarcely knew her. She was a mere child
when he went to England, and during his brief
visits to Kai-Nong afterward he seldom entered
the harem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she inherit none of his property?&rdquo; asked
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She inherits nothing. But she is entitled to a
home in the harem as long as she lives, and our
Celestial and August Emperor will doubtless attend
to her welfare. Nor-Ghai, as she is named,
is quite beautiful, and she will be presented to the
Most Serene Emperor as a candidate for his
harem, in a few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was almost as horrible as the story of the
King Ape, and I was glad our approach to a
beautiful building put an end to the conversation.</p>
<p>We had descended from the mound and passed
through a grove of willow trees, finding before
us the edifice I have referred to. It was very
ornamental in design, and was built almost entirely
of bamboo wands polished to a mirror-like
surface. The workmanship was everywhere exquisite,
and the carving so delicate and flowerlike
that I was amazed. The building was not extensive,
being perhaps thirty feet square, and on
each of its four sides was a flight of steps leading
up to a platform before an entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this must be the House of
Ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said a harsh voice beside me,
and turning I beheld the expressionless, putty-like
countenance of Mai Lo. He reminded me of
&ldquo;old Death&rsquo;s-Head&rdquo; more forcibly than ever, and
I was not at all pleased to have him intrude
upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; I demanded
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my domain,&rdquo; he replied, with a sweep
of his arm. &ldquo;I rule the Ancestral Halls as their
especial guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be the Keeper of the Sacred
Apes,&rdquo; I retorted, with a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my function also,&rdquo; quietly answered
Mai Lo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Somewhat at a loss how to proceed I turned
again to gaze at the Ancestral Halls which were
to play so important a part in our adventures. A
guard paced slowly up and down before each entrance;
not one of the eunuchs, but a soldier in
handsome costume and armed with a naked
scimitar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live in the palace grounds?&rdquo; Joe
asked the governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My residence is there,&rdquo; said Mai Lo, pointing
to a large, substantial building some distance
away. &ldquo;Prince Kai desired me to live near to
the Ancestral Halls. I have another house outside
the walls, in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the body of Prince Kai?&rdquo; suddenly
demanded Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It already rests in the chih of his ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will seal up the vaults at once and
tear down this beautiful building?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon. When the business of the estate
is settled,&rdquo; replied Mai Lo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>The governor did not reply, but I saw a smile
curl the thin lips of the Chief Eunuch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Archie, carelessly, &ldquo;Mai Lo will
put a dagger into his heart and join his prince
in the Land of the Genii, as a faithful servant
should.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Mai Lo turned his glassy eyes upon the speaker,
but said nothing. Evidently it was not pleasant
to be reminded of such a duty, and Archie did
not gain in popularity with the noble governor by
his speech. But we were growing to despise
Mai Lo, and cared little what he thought behind
the impassive mask of his parchment-like features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the inside of that building,&rdquo;
remarked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is forbidden,&rdquo; was the abrupt reply. &ldquo;No
one but Prince Kai and I has been inside it during
this generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do we know that the body of Prince
Kai rests in the tombs of his ancestors?&rdquo; I asked,
maliciously, for I liked to annoy the noble
governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not required of you to know that, or any
other business of this province,&rdquo; returned Mai Lo.
&ldquo;I alone am responsible, and none dares interfere
with my duties. You are here on sufferance,
young men; the sufferance of Wi-to, who is
making a mistake in harboring you. If you abuse
the hospitality extended you, I shall hold Wi-to
responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that, most wise and noble Governor,&rdquo;
returned Wi-to, quietly. &ldquo;Your name is signed
to the order given these young men by Prince
Kai himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not read the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not required to read it,&rdquo; retorted
the eunuch, smiling. &ldquo;Your signature merely
vouches for the genuineness of the illustrious
Prince&rsquo;s order. I but obey that order. Those
responsible are, first of all, the Royal Prince,
himself; and in his absence, Mai Lo, his legal
representative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now the turn of Wi-to to receive the
glassy stare of the governor; but as Mai Lo made
no reply in words we considered that the eunuch
had scored a point.</p>
<p>We now saluted the governor and retired to the
mound of the palace, where he did not attempt to
follow us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is unfortunate,&rdquo; said Wi-to, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;that there are two rulers here with powers so
intermingled that there is likely to be friction
between them. It is the fault of our beloved
Prince, who intrusted the hereditary governor of
his province with more honors than are customary.
But, alas! Mai Lo will soon sleep with
his ancestors, and his son Mai Tchin will rule in
his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the governor has a family,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mai Tchin is better than his father, but
weak and undecided in character. Also he has a
daughter, Mai Mou, who is called the Pearl of
Kai Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she so beautiful?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is reported. My eyes have never been
dazzled by the vision of her presence,&rdquo; said the
eunuch, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Chinese women were not confined
so closely to the harems,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Before they
are married the women of the nobles have much
freedom, and wander at will in the gardens of
their home. Also the married women are
allowed much freedom, and are permitted to visit
one another in their sedan chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>We all laughed at this, and explained to Wi-to
that this did not seem any great privilege when
compared to those of our American girls. But
the idea of allowing girls to meet and converse
with strangers did not appeal to the eunuch, who
thought that Americans must take very little interest
in their female chattels to guard them so
carelessly.</p>
<p>When we got back to the palace Wi took us to
his own room and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are permitted the freedom of the entire
palace, except the royal apartments, and of the
palace grounds except the Halls of Ancestors.
Wander where you will, and enjoy yourselves.
When you are ready to tell me the commands of
our illustrious Prince, which you came here to
execute, I will assist you to carry them out. But
there is no need to hurry; you have a year, by
command of Prince Kai Lun Pu, and I can
extend further courtesy to my master&rsquo;s guests if
I so desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, we had been waiting for an opportunity
to speak of the matters we were here to attend
to, so I said to Wi:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us tell you now of the duties we are required
to perform. We wish to be as frank and
open with you as possible, to show we are grateful
for your trust in us and your faithfulness to your
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed low and waited for me to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know that our Prince made many
warm friends in Europe and America, for every
one loved him who knew him. He was entertained
and shown many favors that he greatly
appreciated. On his death-bed Kai Lun Pu remembered
those friends, and wished to return the
favors he had received. So he asked me and my
two comrades here, to travel to his city of
Kai-Nong and go to his palace here, and there
select such ornaments, ivories and bronzes as
might suit the pleasure of those destined to receive
them. These things we were to choose
from among the contents of this palace, and he
charged us to carefully pack them ourselves in
cases which you, Wi-to, would provide for that
purpose. Then we are to carry them back to our
own country and distribute the gifts to those for
whom they are intended. I have a list of the
names in my possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused here, and again the eunuch bowed
gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you to take many of the treasures and
precious relics from the palace?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We are not to take anything that is of
great value. But among the thousands of articles
gathered here we will select modest gifts for the
friends of the Prince, and you will yourself see
what we have selected and advise us. If there
is anything you prefer to have remain here, we
will respect your wishes. The idea is not to rob
the palace of its treasures; but the Prince gave us
power to select whatever we pleased, so it is our
desire to consult you and your pleasure in making
our choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed pleased by this consideration on
our part, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot quarrel over that matter, since
you are so courteous. Are there any other
commands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We are to get certain books that are
in the rooms which were occupied by the Prince,
and take them with us, to be given to His
Majesty, the King of England.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>I thought it was as well to add to our importance
by naming this important ruler as a friend
of the Prince, and one who was to figure in this
gift distribution. I did not know positively that
the Prince had any books in the palace, but
judged that a young man educated at the English
universities would be more than likely to
own something of a library. Moreover, books
were heavy, and they would remove any suspicion
caused by the weight of the cases we
wanted to carry away.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had guessed correctly. The
eunuch bowed gravely once more, but said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is more difficult to carry out than the
first order, for it is forbidden to allow any one to
enter the royal apartments but the attendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can arrange that by your bringing the
books yourself to another room, where we can
choose what we wish,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>The eunuch brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that will make the order
quite easy to fulfil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a third order,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that
will require more time and perhaps be more difficult.
The Prince wished me to look over all the
documents and papers contained in his private
desk and destroy certain ones I am to find among
them. I suppose the desk is also in the royal
apartments; but that can likewise be brought to
our rooms, where I may make the examination at
my leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying this I paused to see what effect it
might have. I did not know that the Prince had
either a desk or papers; but again I had guessed
aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the key to the great cabinet?&rdquo; inquired
Wi-to, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Kai said you would furnish the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was wholly a chance shot; but it hit the
mark beautifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was the reply. Then he continued:
&ldquo;Our illustrious and sublime Prince has
indeed given you important duties to fulfil, but he
was right in saying that Wi-to would assist you
to do his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sure of your loyalty,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>For a time the eunuch sat thinking upon the
information I had given him. Then, suddenly
raising his eyes, he inquired:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;What reward are you to have for taking this
long journey, and all the trouble and expense of
distributing the Prince&rsquo;s gifts to his friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant I hesitated how to reply to this
question, and I saw the anxious looks on the faces
of Archie and Joe, which warned me of the importance
of my reply. So I marshaled my wits
and smiled at Wi-to to gain time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The Chief Eunuch eyed me expectantly. He
was a clever fellow in his way, and had more
than ordinary intelligence; but all his life had
been passed in this retired place and he judged
people and things from his own limited point of
view. He could understand how his master might
wish to reward friends with costly gifts, because
he had lived surrounded by rare and precious objects
of art. Likewise he supposed books precious,
because there were so few in the palace, and he
had seen so much intrigue in his life that it was
but natural that the Prince wished to destroy certain
papers left in his desk before a successor obtained
possession of them. But he could not
understand our undertaking the commission to
do these things without reward. So when I
answered his question, I said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must not suppose we are mercenary, or
that we journeyed to Kai-Nong solely for a reward;
but Prince Kai did tell us we might each
select a jewel or ornament for ourselves while
we were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just,&rdquo; said the eunuch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will confess that the chief reason for
favoring your Prince, aside from our friendship
for him, was a love of adventure. Mai Lo paid
our expenses here, and will pay to send us back
if we demand it. We have his contract. But if
he is not able to do that, we have funds of our
own in Shanghai which we can draw upon. For,
mark you, Wi-to, we are important people in our
own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of that,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And if
you have a contract with Mai Lo, he must pay to
send you back to Shanghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is alive. But he ought to commit suicide
before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; exclaimed the eunuch. &ldquo;You
intend to compel him to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to see that he doesn&rsquo;t rob the Ancestral
Halls and run away with the treasure.
For that reason we may remain your guests
longer than would be required to execute the
orders of Prince Kai, who greatly feared that Mai
Lo would rob his ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall remain as long as it pleases you,&rdquo;
returned Wi-to, with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;And you
may call upon me and all my followers to assist
you, in case the renegade governor tries to escape
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks; that was just what we expected,&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Then, feeling well satisfied with our interview
and our tour of inspection, we left the Chief
Eunuch and returned to our own rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it wise to harp on the subject of
Mai Lo&rsquo;s robbing the Ancestral Halls?&rdquo; asked
Joe, when we were where we could not be
overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it wise?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Chief Eunuch may get suspicious
that something is up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want him to get suspicious of Mai Lo, and
watch that old fox so carefully that he won&rsquo;t get a
chance to steal anything until we get through.
Besides, it will relieve us of any suspicions. Wi
thinks it&rsquo;s impossible for us to get to the burial
vaults, because our enemy the governor guards
all entrances. And he&rsquo;s crafty enough to believe
that we wouldn&rsquo;t talk about robbing the Ancestral
Halls if we had any idea of doing it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; acknowledged Joe. &ldquo;But I
began to fear we were overdoing the thing. Our
talk about the orders of Prince Kai worked all
right, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was all very reasonable to the
eunuch,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and we will have no trouble in
getting the packing cases to our rooms, where we
can replace the ornaments and books with the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks too easy altogether,&rdquo; said Archie,
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember Prince Kai planned it all,
and he knew the conditions here perfectly,&rdquo;
answered Joe. &ldquo;I imagine our greatest difficulty
will be in getting back to Shanghai. If the governor
acts ugly and refuses us an escort we won&rsquo;t
get fifty miles without being murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s worry about that,&rdquo; I said, sharply,
for the thought had already worried me a good
deal. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another bridge that needn&rsquo;t be
crossed till we come to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were naturally eager to explore the Ancestral
Halls and see what the treasure consisted
of which had been so freely given us by Prince
Kai&mdash;if we could take it. It might be much or
little, but judging from the wealth and magnificence
of the palace the treasure buried in the
vaults was likely to be ample to satisfy us.</p>
<p>After all, I think it was the adventure that
charmed us, more than the longing for gain. We
had been set a difficult task, and boylike we
determined to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Deciding it would not be wise to make any
important move for the first few days, we passed
the time wandering about the palace or in the
grounds. We found that Wi-to trusted us fully
now, and we were allowed to do whatever we
pleased without being annoyed by the watchful
attendance of the eunuchs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Wi asked me if we wanted a guard at the door
of our chamber, and I promptly answered No.
There was no one in the palace except ourselves
and the eunuchs, and it was not necessary for
them to guard us against themselves. So we
were left free to come and go as we pleased; but
when we wandered as far as the outer walls of
the palace enclosure we found eunuchs stationed
at every gateway. We did not know whether we
would be allowed to pass these guards or not, but
we made no attempt to do so, preferring not to
trust ourselves to the mercies of our enemy the
governor.</p>
<p>Once in awhile we encountered Mai Lo in our
walks, but he kept near to the Ancestral Halls
and paid no attention to us. He was supposed
to be settling up the estate of his dead master, but
according to our observations he seemed chiefly
occupied in pacing the paths, in deep thought.
However, we let him alone and kept out of his
way.</p>
<p>It was while we were exploring an end of the
garden where a thicket of fruit trees grew that
we met our first real adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The trees formed a regular jungle; but there
seemed a well worn path between them, so we
followed on, winding this way and that, until
the sound of voices and laughter arrested our
attention. The voices were sweet and fresh and
the laughter ringing and merry.</p>
<p>While we paused to listen, hesitating whether
to retreat or advance, a sentence in English
caught our ears, and we looked at one another in
surprise. Broken English it was, very quaintly
and prettily uttered, and in a girl&rsquo;s voice; but
after hearing it none of us cared to run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen them I have&mdash;a peep&mdash;a view only&mdash;but
they were young and handsome, these foreign
devils,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>
<p>A peal of laughter greeted the remark, and the
chatter went on in lower tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be near the harem,&rdquo; whispered
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cautiously replied Joe. &ldquo;The
harem&rsquo;s way back by the palace. That&rsquo;s a sort
of summer-house ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was merely a circle of willows, with their
branches mingling and interlacing to form a roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve had a peep at us, whoever they are,
I mean to have a peep at them,&rdquo; said I; and without
waiting for a reply I softly tip-toed toward
the willows.</p>
<p>The others followed, but I did not heed them.
Really I was hungry for the sight of a girl,
merely to relieve the monotony of our intercourse
with the harsh-featured eunuchs; but
more than all I was curious.</p>
<p>Halting at the circle of trees I found a place
where I could see the interior between the trunks,
and then I paused spell-bound.</p>
<p>A table of woven reeds was in the center of the
leafy bower, and around it were low chairs and
settles of the same material. Seated at the table
were three young and pretty Chinese girls&mdash;and
if you think a Chinese girl cannot be pretty you
should have seen this group as I saw it.</p>
<p>One maid was leaning on her dainty elbows
over the table, on which lay an open book. She
was not reading it, but looking earnestly at another
maid half reclining upon a bench opposite.
Her eyes were dark and smiling, her teeth white
as pearls, her cheeks like rose leaves and her
hair had a wonderful arrangement of bows and
knitting-needles&mdash;or some such things&mdash;stuck this
way and that to hold it all together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The girl reclining was even prettier, and wore
a wonderful pink gown, all embroidery and fluffy
silk trimmings. I may not be describing all this
properly, but I am doing my best to tell you what
I saw.</p>
<p>There was a third girl sitting upon a stool and
doing a bit of embroidery&mdash;at least she had a
needle and some work in her hands; but she was
not paying much attention to the work, for when
I got to my peep-hole it was this maid&mdash;a tiny,
dainty, dimpled bit of a roguish looking thing&mdash;who
was engaged in talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, Mai Mou&mdash;even if they beat me, or
kill me!&rdquo; she was saying, impetuously; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
a glance myself, this very evening, from my
window, and see what they are like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why need you care, Nor Ghai?&rdquo; asked
the reclining beauty, in a soft, subdued voice.
&ldquo;What if Ko-Tua has seen these foreign devils,
and praises their beauty&mdash;what to you is it all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;To me!&rdquo; returned the impetuous one; &ldquo;they
knew my brother, who has gone to join the
Genii. I loved well our Lun Pu, who never knew
me or cared for me. Perhaps the fearful, handsome
strangers will tell me of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew who they were now&mdash;at least, two of
them. Nor Ghai was the little sister of the
Prince&mdash;she was the girl with the embroidery.
Mai Mou was the daughter of our enemy the
governor; she was well named the Pearl of
Kai-Nong. As for the third, the beauty with
the book, who had been called Ko-Tua and who
claimed to have had a peep at us, I had no idea
where she belonged.</p>
<p>But what I had overheard decided me upon a
bold step. It would have been bold even in
America; here in China it was actually audacious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>I saw the opening in the willows that formed
the entrance to this leafy pavilion, and crept
toward it, motioning the boys to follow. When
near enough I boldly stepped out, walked into
the pavilion and then paused as if astonished at
what I had discovered there. Archie and Joe
were with me, and we were greeted by a panicky
chorus of muffled screams. Lucky it was they
were muffled, or the cries might have brought the
eunuchs upon us. Perhaps the frightened girls
remembered this and screamed just loud enough
to show they were properly scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon us, ladies, for intruding,&rdquo; I said, removing
my cap and making a low bow. &ldquo;We
are the foreign devils, and we&rsquo;re glad to make
your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNLAWFUL INTERVIEW.</span></h2>
<p>Really, we had created a sensation in the summer-house.
The three beauties were huddled together
in a bunch as far away as the circling
willows would permit, and with clasped hands
and wide open eyes they were staring at us
intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit us to introduce ourselves,&rdquo; said Joe,
in his most polite manner. &ldquo;I am Joseph Herring,
of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Archie Ackley, of the same grand
old country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Sam Steele, at your service, ladies.
Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;Now that
we are here let us tell you all about Prince Kai
Lun Pu, and how he sent us to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; said Mai Mou, in low tense tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you must,&rdquo; persisted the Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Archie, calmly seating himself
at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be sliced if you are found here,&rdquo;
announced Nor Ghai, with a dimpled smile, half
frightened, half amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sliced! What does that mean, little friend?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are bound to the plank and the axe begins
at your feet and slices you thin until you
are dead&mdash;and long afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Archie, contemptuously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you care not to consider yourselves, then
consider us,&rdquo; begged the fair Ko-Tua. &ldquo;If you
are found here we shall be beaten with bamboos
upon the soles of our feet and cast into dungeons
without food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I said, assuringly. &ldquo;I will
not allow the eunuchs to harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you prevent it?&rdquo; asked Mai Mou,
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our authority,&rdquo; I replied, exhibiting
the Prince&rsquo;s ruby ring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rdquo; sighed Nor Ghai, gliding swiftly
toward me. Then she knelt and touched the
ring with her rose-bud lips, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his, Mai Mou! It is my brother&rsquo;s signet,
Ko-Tua! We need fear nothing, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit down and let&rsquo;s talk it over,&rdquo; I said,
motioning toward the chairs.</p>
<p>Very timidly they approached, like frightened
doves about to fly at the least alarm, and then
they plumped down upon a bench all together,
with their arms twined around each other for
mutual encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it happen you speak English?&rdquo; I
inquired, pretending not to notice their fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my father&rsquo;s wives lived at Hong-Kong
before he brought her here, and she
taught us,&rdquo; replied Nor Ghai, simply. &ldquo;Do you
think we the English speak with perfection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more perfect,&rdquo; laughed
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rdquo; they murmured, looking at each
other delightedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;We the English talk much with ourselves,&rdquo;
declared Ko-Tua, casting her eyes down modestly
to avoid Joe&rsquo;s stare. &ldquo;We can faster talk
in English than in our own language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great blessing,&rdquo; said Archie; &ldquo;you
must have a lot to say to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we study all the time, velly hard and
good,&rdquo; added Mai Mou, looking earnestly at
Archie for approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are very wise and learned,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; broke in Nor Ghai, wiggling expectantly
in her seat, &ldquo;tell me of Lun Pu&mdash;all of
Lun Pu&mdash;and how he came to join his ancestors,
and how you foreign dev&mdash;you, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;re foreign devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you came to Kai-Nong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; I rejoined; &ldquo;you are the Prince&rsquo;s
sister, I believe; Nor Ghai by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; she exclaimed, clasping
her hands with a little gesture of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this must be Mai Mou, the governor&rsquo;s
daughter, called by all the world the Pearl of
Kai-Nong,&rdquo; added Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Do you
know everything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; laughed Joe. &ldquo;For instance, we
do not know who Ko-Tua is. Will she tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Ko-Tua was not the least charming of
the little maids by any means. Her features were
not quite so regular as those of Mai Mou, nor
so merry and winning as those of Nor Ghai;
but she was sweet and dainty as a spring floweret
and her eyes had a pleading and wistful look
that was hard to resist. So we were all greatly
astonished when Mai Mou answered Joe&rsquo;s question
by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ko-Tua is my little mother; she is my father&rsquo;s
new wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Has the old governor
been marrying since he returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-no!&rdquo; answered Ko-Tua, smiling and
blushing. &ldquo;I was married to the noble Mai Lo
six years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! How old are you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked inquiringly at Mai Mou, who
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen summers has Mai Mou looked upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were married at nine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;That must be it,&rdquo; she nodded, counting upon
her slender fingers. &ldquo;Ten&mdash;&rsquo;leven&mdash;tlelve&mdash;thirt&rsquo;&mdash;fourt&mdash;fliftleen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous!&rdquo; cried Joe, indignantly.
&ldquo;The old rascal ought to be sliced for daring to
marry a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; asked Mai Mou, wonderingly.
&ldquo;Is not my little mother beautiful? Is
she not nice? Is not my father&rsquo;s harem well
appointed and comforting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy, Ko-Tua?&rdquo; asked Joe, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, foreign one. Only the birds are
happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t slice Mai Lo,&rdquo; I announced,
airily.</p>
<p>I picked up the book that lay open upon the
table and found it an English translation of
Plutarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; they cried. And Ko-Tua added:
&ldquo;We are entertain much by its stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed pretty heavy reading for young
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have the Shakespeare and we have the
verse songs of Blylon,&rdquo; announced Nor Ghai,
gleefully. &ldquo;My brother, Lun Pu, gave them to
my father&rsquo;s wife who came from Hong Kong.
But now you may tell us, foreign ones, since you
are with us so unlawfully, about my brother&rsquo;s
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we began the story, trying between us to
tell it in such a way as to remove all horror
from the tragic incidents. But it seemed they
loved to dwell mostly upon those very details,
having the same love for slaughter and bloodshed
that I have observed in the natures of
some of our own children. Even Nor Ghai had
known the Prince so slightly that he was a mere
personage to her, and his untimely end was to
these fair and innocent girls but a romance that
was delightful to listen to.</p>
<p>With the telling of the story and answering
the numerous questions showered upon us, the
hours passed rapidly, until finally Ko-Tua sprang
up and declared it was time for them to go, or
Mai Lo&rsquo;s eunuchs would be looking for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come here again tomorrow?&rdquo; I asked
Nor Ghai, taking her little hand in mine&mdash;a liberty
she did not resent.</p>
<p>She turned to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we come here tomorrow?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Mai Mou looked at her &ldquo;little mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come,&rdquo; said Ko-Tua, after a little
hesitation. &ldquo;We shall then be able to learn more
of the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor Ghai laughed at that and said, with a
pretty courtesy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they glided from the pavilion with quick
little steps that were not ungraceful, and we
stood silently in our places until all sounds of
their departure had ceased.</p>
<p>We were much elated by this meeting, and had
no thought of the danger we might incur by arranging
for a future interview with the charming
orientals. You must not think we had fallen
in love with these Chinese beauties, for that was
not the case. I don&rsquo;t say that I shall never fall
in love; but when I do it will be with an American
girl, and it won&rsquo;t matter much whether she
is beautiful or not, so long as I love her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>But I think every well regulated young fellow
is fond of chatting with nice girls, and in this
heathen country we were so beset with dangers
and had so little companionship outside of our
circle of three, that it was a pleasant change to
meet these pretty maids and converse with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong, you know,&rdquo; remarked Archie, as
we wandered slowly back to the palace. &ldquo;That
is, from the standard of Chinese etiquette. We
may really get &lsquo;sliced&rsquo; if we keep up the meetings,
and even if we escape that, the girls will be terribly
punished if they&rsquo;re caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Do you think the
ring would save us in this case, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would with Wi, but we&rsquo;ve got to
figure on the old governor finding out that we&rsquo;re
associating with his wife and daughter. I&rsquo;m convinced
that would make him furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go ahead,&rdquo; said Archie, grinning
with delight. &ldquo;It will do me good to worry old
Mai Lo into fits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he finds it out, he&rsquo;ll be sure to resort
to slicing,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;if he can get his hands
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The girls come here
to visit Nor Ghai, and that&rsquo;s how we happened
to meet them. It&rsquo;s different from our intruding
into the governor&rsquo;s harem, or even into the harem
of the palace. If Mai Lo doesn&rsquo;t want his wife
and daughter to meet strangers he should keep
them safe at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are he doesn&rsquo;t know they are in
the habit of visiting Nor Ghai,&rdquo; observed Archie.
&ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m going to have all the fun I can,
in spite of old Death&rsquo;s-Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That expressed our sentiments exactly. We
were foolish, I admit; but boys are apt to be
foolish at times, and some great writer&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
remember his name&mdash;has said that a woman is
at the bottom of every misfortune.</p>
<p>Here were three of them, and they looked
harmless enough. So we voluntarily thrust our
heads into the trap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SECRET PASSAGE.</span></h2>
<p>When we met the girls in the secluded pavilion
the next afternoon, we found that Nor Ghai had
brought the Shakespeare and Byron, and she
begged us to explain certain passages in them
that had puzzled the fair students of English.
This we did, and before we parted that day a
friendly footing had been established between us
that was very pleasant indeed. Of course another
interview was arranged for, as all of us
had become reassured by our success in escaping
observation, and if we still had any qualms of
fear we did not allow them to prevent future
meetings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>But the girls were more alive to the conditions
surrounding them than we were, and their fertile
brains arranged a series of signals to let us
know whether it was safe to enter the pavilion
or not, since at any time one of the eunuchs or
older members of the harem might see fit to accompany
them. Also they timed their stay by
our watches, so as to leave before there was a
chance of their being sought for.</p>
<p>All this savored of intrigue, but our meetings
were harmless enough. I don&rsquo;t say that little
Nor Ghai was averse to a bit of flirtation, but
none of us encouraged her because we had no
thought of flirting with our new friends. We
talked in boyish fashion and treated them exactly
as if we were brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Meantime the days flew swiftly by, and still
Mai Lo paced the gravel paths before the Ancestral
Halls of Kai, and we hesitated to begin
our appointed task. But finally one evening,
while talking over our plans and chances of success,
Joe proposed that we should explore the
secret passage and accustom ourselves to the
way to the underground vaults; so we promptly
decided upon the adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>At about ten o&rsquo;clock, the usual time, we dismissed
our eunuch, Tun, who always remained
in waiting until we retired for the night, and
then, instead of going to bed, we put out our
lights and sat quietly in the darkness until after
midnight.</p>
<p>Every time we had passed by the bend in the
hall we had noticed the tapestry of the dragon,
but never had we ventured to disturb it to see
what was behind the hangings. We dared not
show a light in this passage because just around
the bend was the guard of the royal apartments,
eternally pacing up and down to prevent anyone
from penetrating to the sacred precincts.</p>
<p>We had, unfortunately, no candles; but I had
unhooked a small oil lamp from a bracket in one
of our rooms, and matches were plentiful. When
I softly opened our door to listen, there was not
a sound to be heard throughout the palace except
the steady footfalls of the distant guard; so,
being in our stocking-feet, we tip-toed along the
corridor, feeling our way in the darkness by
keeping one hand on the wall, until we reached
the bend in the passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>We could not see the dragon tapestry, but
knowing its exact location I crept beneath the
heavy drapery, followed closely by Archie and
Joe, and then began to feel for the bronze knob.</p>
<p>Across the face of the wall in every direction
we fumbled, and I had almost begun to despair
of finding it without a light when Joe grasped
my shoulder and guided my hand to a tiny projection
far to the left.</p>
<p>Yes; it was a knob, all right. I grasped it
and pulled it toward me, and at once we heard
a faint swish, and a breath of colder air reached
us. I felt along the wall, and found an opening,
through which I passed, drawing the others with
me. Another heavy tapestry was on this side
of the wall, and we crept beneath its folds on
hands and knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s safe to scratch a match?&rdquo;
I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be done, safe or unsafe,&rdquo; replied
Joe, and in a moment a faint light flared up, and
Joe shaded it with his hands while I cast a hurried
glance at the tapestry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No light can shine through that, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Here, Joe; light the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>I held it while he touched the match to the
wick, and then we stood up and gazed curiously
around us.</p>
<p>We found ourselves in a lofty sleeping chamber
that was beautifully furnished. The carved
mahogany bedstead with its pagoda-like canopy
towered fully fifteen feet in height, and its curtains
were cloth-of-gold. Around the frieze, just
above the heavy tapestry hangings, was a row
of embossed golden fishes with ivory horns, set
in a background of azure blue. Near to where
we stood, at the left of the secret panel, a number
of bronze tablets were attached to the wall,
their faces engraved with Chinese characters.
I supposed these to be the tablets of ancestors,
which every house contains in its inmost sanctum.
Before the tablets was a sort of altar, containing
a vase for burning incense and prayers.</p>
<p>A broad archway, hung with stiff draperies,
formed a communication with the next room
of the suite, and just beyond it stood a great
carved cabinet with numerous drawers and recesses
and a writing shelf in the center. This I
thought must be the Prince&rsquo;s &ldquo;desk&rdquo; which I
had asked the Chief Eunuch to remove to my
room, without realizing its size. That he had
promised to do so filled me with wonder, for I
doubted if it could be carried through the archway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Passing around the huge bedstead and holding
the lamp before us, we peered into the further
corner of the room and with one accord shrank
back in sudden fear. For before us stood a gigantic
form in glittering armor, with a face-mask so
terrible in expression that it might well cause a
sinking of the heart. And behind the mask glittered
two cruel, piercing eyes, while the right
arm swung a scimitar as if about to attack the
beholder and hack him asunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; muttered Joe, with a low laugh.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t alive, although it looks it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the statue we were searching for,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder it used to scare the Prince,&rdquo; remarked
Archie. &ldquo;Ugh! I shouldn&rsquo;t want to own
that fellow for an ancestor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the first Kai,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;They
must have been giants in those days, if he&rsquo;s a
sample warrior.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Then I leaned down and tried to press outward
the left foot of the statue, which stood flat upon
the floor without any pedestal. It resisted and
I knelt down and tried again, pushing with all
my strength and using the other foot as a purchase.
The foot gave a little&mdash;not more than
half an inch&mdash;and I heard a sharp click and a
grating sound behind the tapestries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Joe, pushing aside the drapery
while Archie held the lamp. &ldquo;The panel is open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening disclosed was about five feet
high and not more than eighteen inches wide,
but it was sufficient to allow us to pass through
with ease. A secret passage, narrow and low,
had been built in the great side-wall of the palace,
and a few paces from the panel a flight of
steps, made of stone, led downward. These continued
to descend until we had passed below the
foundations of the building, when we entered a
tunnelled passage slanting straight into the earth.
The walls were protected with stone and cement,
but there was a damp, musty smell in the passage;
and, as we advanced, numerous vermin, such as
rats, lizards and fat spiders, scampered away
from the path to hide in the little nooks between
the stones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Archie, who went first, carrying the lamp,
growled continually at these pests, but I felt they
could not be dangerous or the Prince would have
warned us against them.</p>
<p>We traveled what seemed a very long distance
to us, under the circumstances; but I now believe
the passage was a bee-line to the burial vaults
from the palace, and of course the vaults were
located some distance from the building that
appeared above ground. But my sense of direction
was so confused that I would then, and even
afterward, have been unable to locate the vaults
from the palace grounds.</p>
<p>Finally we reached a steel door which was unlocked
and opened easily. Beyond this hung a
tapestry, and pushing that aside we came to an
alcove, arched high above us and having a grating
of bronze or similar metal at the further side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>In the center of the alcove lay a superb sarcophagus
or burial casket, set across two slabs
of marble. This was of wrought bronze and bore
upon the cover a mask with a surprising resemblance
to the statue of the first Kai in the Prince&rsquo;s
bedroom.</p>
<p>We did not pause to examine it long, however,
for all about the coffin stood carven stands and
taborets weighted with curious ornaments in
solid gold and silver, while upon a low table
were several suits of splendid armor, inlaid with
gold and set with precious stones that glistened
brightly under the lamplight. Nor was this all.
Ornaments of green and yellow jade were scattered
about, and at the foot of the coffin stood a
semi-circle of big jars of bronze.</p>
<p>I thrust my hand into one of these jars and
drew it out filled with beautiful emeralds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to go any farther, boys!&rdquo; I
exclaimed with a gasp. &ldquo;Here are riches enough,
in this one niche, to satisfy a dozen fortune
hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie examined another vase and found rubies
and pearls in it. The third was quite empty, and
so was the fourth, but the fifth and last one contained
many jade rings, bracelets and necklaces,
with which were mingled several large sapphires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Archie, sighing; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s more
treasure than the priests of Luxor buried in the
desert. But let&rsquo;s continue our explorations. This
can&rsquo;t be all of the ancestral chih, for only one
ancestor is buried here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been very rich in his lifetime,
if this was but half of his fortune,&rdquo; remarked Joe.
&ldquo;I wonder if he got it all honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;This fellow is an
ancient, and perhaps lived in an age of robbing
and pillaging. But come on, fellows; let&rsquo;s see if
we can pass those gratings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a catch, worked from either side, held the
grating in place, and swinging it open we passed
into what was doubtless an immense domed chamber,
for our tiny lamp could not light more than
a small portion of it. On either side of the alcove
from which we had emerged hung magnificent
tapestries worked in threads of gold and silver
and representing scenes of battles, processions and
the like. The workmanship was so fine on the
first tapestry we examined that it seemed impossible
it could be anything but a painting, and a
marvelous one at that. But we found the other
fifty or more sections hung around the domed
chamber to be equally perfect in execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Beyond the tapestry hangings, each section of
which was some sixteen feet in width, was another
grating leading to an alcove, and this system
we afterward found was continued all around
the chamber. None of the gratings were locked
and all opened readily to our touch. The alcove
we next entered contained another splendid casket
and even more golden ornaments and precious
gems than we had found in the first. We accounted
for the empty jars in the first alcove,
which connected with the secret passage, by the
pilfering from them by Prince Kai, of which he
had told us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, as we eagerly
started to examine the next alcove. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not
careful we&rsquo;re going to lose our bearings in this
big place and get lost. Before we wander any
further away let&rsquo;s mark the grating to the alcove
we came from when we entered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>That seemed good advice, so we retraced our
steps until we reached the first alcove, where Joe
tied his handkerchief to the grating. Then, feeling
assured we could find the place again, we
proceeded upon our explorations.</p>
<p>We had examined five or six of the chih, or
alcoves of the dead, all of which contained enormous
wealth, when suddenly I stumbled against
a low stand just outside of a grating. Holding
the lamp high to see what the obstruction was, I
found upon the stand a large lamp, nearly filled
with oil, and a box of London safety-matches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;Mai Lo has been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he can now wander through these
ancestral vaults at will, since there is no one to
forbid him,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t decide to come while we&rsquo;re
here,&rdquo; remarked Archie, &ldquo;or our pretty plans will
be nipped in the bud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t necessary for Mai Lo to lose sleep
to enter these vaults,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But it is as
well to be on our guard, and I&rsquo;m glad we found
the evidences of his visit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Entering the alcove before which the table and
lamp stood, we looked around with astonishment,
for here was more evidence of Mai Lo&rsquo;s presence
in the tomb. This niche was evidently very rich
in treasure, and the vases and bowls of gems had
been emptied into a great heap in the center of
the floor. From this heap some one had been
assorting the jewels into varieties and sizes. In
one place were pearls, the finest of which had been
placed in one row, the next largest in a second
row, and so on.</p>
<p>Rubies had been assorted in a similar way on
another side of the chih, and emeralds in a third
place. No jewels seemed to have been taken
away, and from the size of the heap there was
much more assorting to be done, and the job was
scarcely begun.</p>
<p>The beauty of the row of great pearls appealed
to Archie strongly, so he picked them up, one by
one, and placed them in the pocket of his jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything should prevent our coming here
again,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;these pearls will well repay
us for our journey to Kai-Nong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he never suspected that they were likely
nearly to cost us all our lives.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TREASURE OF THE ANCIENTS.</span></h2>
<p>From alcove to alcove we went, finding in each
a different class of treasure, according to the
wealth of the occupant and the period in which
he had lived. Here a scholar was laid, and beside
him a mass of parchment manuscripts, which
either represented a half of his fortune or had
been purchased at such high prices that his heir
preferred to bury the manuscripts with his ancestor
and keep the half of his wealth represented
by more tangible assets. In another place we
found many painted pictures, in another bales of
silks, rotted and fallen to decay. But usually the
wealth of these ancestors of Kai Lun Pu consisted
of splendid gems and jewelry, ornaments of gold,
silver and jade, and in many cases golden coins of
the Empire. Well might Prince Kai say that his
Ancestral Halls contained enough wealth to ransom
a kingdom. To carry it all away with us
would have required a railway train or the hold
of a steamship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;What we must do,&rdquo; said Joe, who was a fair
judge of gems and jewelry, &ldquo;is to select only
rubies, emeralds and pearls, and perhaps some of
the fine jades. These may be carried in a small
space, if we don&rsquo;t take too many of them, and
they&rsquo;ll sell more readily at home for cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We quite agreed with him in this, and believed
we would now be able to order the packing cases
of such a size as to fit our needs. We might have
some trouble in carrying our plunder through
China to Shanghai, and to strive to take too much
of this almost inexhaustible wealth might very
easily cause us to lose it all.</p>
<p>So eager and excited were we by the sight of
this splendid treasure-house that we lingered in
the tombs a long time, and finally reached an
alcove where rested the casket we had made
aboard the <i>Seagull</i>, and which contained the bandaged
pillows and bolsters that had been substituted
for the body of Prince Kai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>It was still locked, and had not been disturbed
in any way by Mai Lo; nor was there any treasure
beside it. From there on to the alcove where
we had entered, and where Joe&rsquo;s handkerchief
was attached to the grating, the niches were
empty. These ancestral chih would have accommodated
several generations yet, had not the last
of the royal line perished without an heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! It&rsquo;s after four o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; exclaimed
Archie, leaning over to examine his watch
by the flame of the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must hustle back,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for it
begins to get daylight at five, and we mustn&rsquo;t get
caught in the passages of the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we ran into the alcove of the first Kai and
closed the grating behind us. Then we thrust
aside the tapestry, passed through the steel door,
and fastened it securely. A moment more and we
were treading the tunnel in single file back to the
palace.</p>
<p>The way was up hill now, and harder walking,
but it did not seem so long as it did when we came
down. In a few minutes we had reached the stone
steps and were climbing them to the chamber of
the Prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>The sliding panel behind the statue puzzled us
a little, but we soon discovered how to close it,
and it caught in place with the same little click
that had released it when the foot was pushed
aside.</p>
<p>Without pausing again in the bed-chamber, we
crept beneath the tapestry and out of the panel
door into the corridor, and then paused to listen
with bated breath. The guard could still be
heard treading heavily before the door to the
Suite of the Horned Fish; so we took off our
shoes again, pushed aside the dragon tapestry,
and noiselessly crept to our own room.</p>
<p>You may be sure we breathed easier when we
were safe within our own quarters, for day was
just breaking and our return had been timed none
too soon.</p>
<p>Nux and Bryonia, whom we had left to guard
our rooms from possible intrusion while we were
absent, were mighty glad to see us back again,
and their eyes opened wide with astonishment
when Archie displayed his pearls as proof that
we had found the treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>But the night of excitement had wearied us
greatly, so we all turned in and slept like dead
men until our faithful blacks called us to breakfast.</p>
<p>It was while we were at this meal that Joe
uttered an exclamation, and glancing up I saw his
face go white and frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, old man?&rdquo; I asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My handkerchief!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I left it tied
to the grating of the alcove!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at one another in stupid bewilderment
for a moment, trying hard to think how to
remedy such a blunder. But nothing could be
done for that day, anyhow, and if Mai Lo happened
to visit the Ancestral Halls during that
time he would have ample proof that we had
been there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he may not notice it,&rdquo; said Archie,
comfortingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a regular flag&mdash;white against all
those dark hues of tapestries and black spots of
alcoves. Of course he&rsquo;ll notice it,&rdquo; retorted Joe
with a groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more than he&rsquo;ll notice the absence of
the pearls,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Mai Lo is evidently
busy assorting the treasure he means to run away
with, and his first visit there will assure him
someone else has been in the vaults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but without the handkerchief he would
be unable to guess who it was,&rdquo; answered Joe.
&ldquo;The handkerchief gives him just the clew he
needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the governor can&rsquo;t do
anything about it that I can see. If he is onto
our game, we are also onto his, and he won&rsquo;t dare
whisper to the people outside that he is visiting
the vaults. When he enters the building he is
supposed to be praying, and he must not enter
the underground chih after laying the body of
the Prince there. His only legitimate business
now is to seal up the vaults and destroy all traces
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then make an end of himself,&rdquo; added
Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>But in spite of our brave talk we were decidedly
uneasy over the way in which we had
bungled our adventure of the night, and as soon
as breakfast was finished we started out with one
accord and took the path that led to the Ancestral
Halls.</p>
<p>Nux followed us, but Bry remained in our
rooms. This plan we had adopted several days
before, having only one of our blacks with us
when we ventured out of the palace and leaving
the other to guard the entrance to our apartments.
The reason for this procedure was that we soon
expected to accumulate considerable treasure in
our rooms, and we wanted it understood that we
permitted no intrusion further than the outer reception-room.
Indeed, Bry was guarding, this
morning, a few pearls that Joe estimated to be
worth over fifty thousand dollars; and the way
he did it was to tie them in a handkerchief and
carry them in his pocket. As for separating our
faithful servants, it was evident that nothing could
ever be done in this place by brute force, and a
thousand men would be of no more use to us
than one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>We sauntered carelessly along, so as not to convey
the impression that we had any object in our
walk more than to get a bit of air and exercise.
Often we passed the magnificently attired household
eunuchs, singly or in groups; but we had
now become familiar sights to these creatures, and
they merely touched their yellow turbans respectfully
and passed on.</p>
<p>Around the outbuildings the place thronged
with less important servants, all under the general
command of Wi-to and his lieutenants.
Sounds of industry came from the House of the
Artisans, where the bronze, brass and gold workers
were busy. In front of the House of the
Weavers were groups throwing shuttles back and
forth or spinning the threads to be used in the
looms.</p>
<p>Kitchen servants passed and repassed in every
direction, and this part of the grounds was in
many ways the most interesting of all, for here
beat the pulse that gave life to the whole establishment.</p>
<p>Moving on, we took the path descending the
mound toward the Ancestral Halls&mdash;not the one
that led past the cage of Sacred Apes, for we
hated those fearful creatures and avoided them&mdash;but
a shaded, winding way that was very pleasant,
though it led past a pond of black water which
was said to be the home of a monster Devil-Fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Before long we came to a halt directly in front
of the north entrance of the beautiful bamboo palace
of the dead, and the soldier on guard, radiant
in the crimson and sapphire uniform of the governor&rsquo;s
service, waved his scimitar partly in salute
and partly in warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo?&rdquo; I said to him, questioningly.</p>
<p>He spoke no English, but could not fail to
understand I was asking for the governor; so he
turned his thumb toward the entrance, to indicate
that his master was inside the building, and then
resumed his strut back and forth before the door.</p>
<p>Well, that was all we wanted to know, and our
hearts sank as we realized that our enemy was
even now in the underground chih examining the
traces of our midnight visit there. We slowly
turned and retraced our steps as far as a group
of trees that stood a little way up the mound and
commanded an unobstructed view of the entire
House of Ancestors. Here we seated ourselves
upon shady benches and passed the next two hours
moodily talking over the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>At the end of that time we observed Mai Lo
appear from the building by the entrance nearest
us. He was as deliberate and reserved in demeanor
as ever, and after a word to the guard he
took the very path that led past the trees where
we were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out,&rdquo; advised Archie, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stay and hear what the
old duffer has to say. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk up
to him, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was my promise.</p>
<p>Then we grimly awaited the governor&rsquo;s approach.
He paced steadily up the path, his hands
clasped behind his back and his face turned square
to the front.</p>
<p>So he reached the trees and came to a halt before
our bench. Upon his parchment-like yellow
face there was no sign of expression; in the
bead-like eyes turned upon us was no ray of intelligence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Without doubt Mai Lo had been astounded by
the discovery he had made that morning: that
we were able to penetrate to the sacred chih of
the Ancestors of Kai. If he was human, he must
have been stirred to the very depths of his nature.
But here he stood, as passionless and cold as a
statue, his glassy stare wandering from one to
another of us in turn, but no word passing his
thin, compressed lips.</p>
<p>What a relief it would have been had he denounced
us, threatened us, cursed us for foreign
devils and scoundrels! But no. He merely fixed
his soulless eyes upon us, and I began to realize
how the ancient Greeks might have got their idea
of Medusa and the terrible gaze that turned men
to stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ROYAL CABINET.</span></h2>
<p>When the governor had gone&mdash;and he returned
along the path as silently as he had come, after
his passionless inspection of us&mdash;we arose and
walked to the palace, finding mighty little to say
on our own account.</p>
<p>On the broad piazza that led into the main
building of the palace we found the Chief Eunuch,
leaning heavily against a pillar. I had been trying
to communicate with Wi-to for several days,
but Tun, who carried our messages, always returned
to say that his master was closely occupied
with his duties and begged to postpone the
interview. During these days we had neither seen
nor heard of the Chief Eunuch, so I was a little
surprised to find him on the piazza. His face
was haggard and worn, his eyes puffy and bloodshot
and his person untidy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Wi,&rdquo; said I, cordially. &ldquo;Have
you been ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at me rather childishly, and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Earth Dragon has had me in his coils&mdash;and
nearly strangled me. Ah&mdash;oh! how unhappy
I have been! Who has such deep and dreadful
sorrows as poor Wi-to? Who suffers such horrible
pangs? Who&mdash;but never mind. The sun-god
is smiling this morning, and the breeze is
sweet and lovely. Are my master&rsquo;s guests wholly
content? Have they any orders for their lowly
servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I own this rambling, inconsequent speech somewhat
puzzled me. Wi-to did not seem himself;
he was surely not at his best today. Ordinarily
the Chief Eunuch was the most intelligent,
shrewd, courteous and agreeable Chinaman we
had met, save only Prince Kai Lun Pu.</p>
<p>But I pretended not to notice his peculiar
bearing and asked him when he could have the
desk of Prince Kai moved into our rooms. I
wanted to begin my work of inspection at once,
I told him; but really the only reason I made the
request at all was to allay any suspicions he might
harbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>To my surprise he at once blew his whistle
and brought a dozen eunuchs running to answer
the summons. Still leaning against the pillar
Wi-to chattered away in Chinese for a time until
his men prostrated themselves and hurried away
to fulfil his commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabinet will come to you, my master,&rdquo;
now answered the eunuch. &ldquo;Is there anything
else I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as regards the selection of the
gifts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry,&rdquo; he interrupted, rubbing one eye
with his knuckles. &ldquo;Tlake it easy; much time;
no hurry; only Mai Lo want you out of the way.
Mai Lo? Dlam Mai Lo! English dlam. Pah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really, I couldn&rsquo;t understand Wi-to in this peculiar
condition, so we left him still leaning
against the post and went away to our own rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Pretty soon there was considerable racket in
the passageway, and we sent Bry to see what it
meant. He returned grinning from ear to ear,
and said the eunuchs were moving a house. So
we looked out, and there were some twenty or
more of the palace servants, perspiring and struggling
with the immense cabinet that had been
standing in the Prince&rsquo;s bed-chamber. How they
ever moved it at all was a wonder; but move it
they did, inch by inch, and squeezed it through
the great entrance door to our reception-room.
I had them place it against the wall nearest the
door and then they went away glad that the task
was accomplished.</p>
<p>It was an absurd thing to do, and in all reason
and common sense we should have been permitted
to examine the cabinet where it originally stood;
but oriental prejudices are difficult things to overcome,
and since it was forbidden strangers to
enter the royal apartments, the mountainous cabinet
had to come to Mahomet Sam.</p>
<p>Now I had no right, as a matter of fact, to
examine this private cabinet of the royal line of
Kai, and my request to do so was but a blind
to further our real plans. But since it was here,
and since Wi-to had sent me a bunch of keys to
unlock the different compartments, the temptation
to look inside was irresistible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; I said to the boys; &ldquo;if we
don&rsquo;t look over these things, others who may
not be as friendly to Prince Kai&rsquo;s memory are
sure to do so. The estate and palace will shortly
pass to the Emperor, who will either retain it
for himself or give it to some favorite. So I
believe we are justified in seeing what this old
mystery-box contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They agreed with me fully, so we began the
examination. First we opened the desk part and
found many documents in Chinese, sealed, signed
and filed in a very business-like manner. These
we could not read, and their importance was all
unknown to us. Also there were numerous letters.
One bunch of yellow missives bore the
Imperial Vermilion Seal of the Emperor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>In order to carry out our deception I tore up
a number of the least important looking papers
and burned them in a brazier. At the bottom of
the heap of letters I found a book in which the
Prince had written in English a sort of diary,
although the entries were seldom dated and
seemed to be whimsical sentences he had recorded
merely to relieve his mind. The poor fellow had
had no one around him in whom he could confide,
as to an intimate friend; so he had made this
little book his confidant.</p>
<p>Believing that here, if anywhere we would be
likely to find clews to guide us in our undertaking,
we read this book aloud, so that among the
three of us, to say nothing of Nux and Bry, we
might catch whatever ideas it contained that
might be of service to us.</p>
<p>Many of the passages were sarcastic comparisons
between the customs of his own people and
those of Europeans, and I must admit that, from
Prince Kai&rsquo;s point of view, the Europeans did
not always come out best. One entry that interested
us was as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;What unselfish and responsible servants am I
blest with! What competent officials direct my
affairs in my absence! Look upon them, oh my
ancestors, and pity me. At the head of my province
is a man born to be its governor who, lacking
such birthright, would be unfit for the duties of
the humblest slave. Cold, unfeeling, ambitious
and without honor, this man works but for his
own selfish interests, and lacks the strength of
intellect to ruin me for his own gain. Since I
read him so truly he cannot injure me; but what
a farce is this hereditary right to govern a great
province such as Kwang-Kai-Nong! When Mai
Lo lies with his ancestors there will be his son
to govern, a weak imbecile, helplessly degenerate.
I am quite certain I must find an excuse to behead
both father and son, that I may free myself of
this incubus of the House of Kai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fuh-yin of the city of Kai-Nong is even
a worse scoundrel than Mai Lo. I have proof
that he murdered his own brother, in order to become
mayor and rob the city of its revenues.
Some day when I have time I shall accuse and
condemn my Fuh-yin, and invent a horrible execution
worthy of his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the palace the one power is the Chief
Eunuch, who might make things very unpleasant
for me were he not by nature faithful and obedient
to his master. I made him chief when old
Koa-Ming-Dhu was stabbed by one of my father&rsquo;s
wives, raising Wi-to from the ranks of the
eunuchs. I believe he is grateful, and so am
willing to overlook his one weakness. For Wi-to
gets drunk periodically, and frequently stays
drunk a week, and while he is in this condition
everything about the palace is neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Joe, when I read this extract.
&ldquo;That was the trouble with Wi-to today. He&rsquo;s
been on a drunk and is just coming &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an unfortunate trait,&rdquo; I said, musingly.
&ldquo;For if we happened to need the services of the
Chief Eunuch and he failed us, being on one of
his sprees, we might lose our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently we found another interesting item in
the book. It said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making a careful inspection of the
riches contained in the tombs of my ancestors.
It seems strange that I am the first of our race
to abjure ancestor worship and look upon these
dead effigies of my forefathers as they really are&mdash;heaps
of dust. Nothing could be more foolish,
according to the enlightened age in which I live,
than burying wealth in the tomb of its owner,
where neither he nor any one else can apply it
to use. Yet so ingrained in my nature are
racial prejudices that it was long before I could
induce myself to touch that wealth. When finally
I did so I took the contents of several jars in the
chih of the first Kai. The Jews to whom I sold
the treasure in London robbed me, but I obtained
enough money to make a lavish display of wealth
while I was at college. But today I discovered
a rare treasure indeed in the tombs of my ancestors.
It is in the chih of Kai-Abon, the seventh
of our royal race. The contents of his alcove
seemed so unattractive that I had never given the
place much attention before; but today I discovered
that the great wealth of this prince was carefully
arranged to deceive any one who might be
tempted by an open display. Turning over a heap
of cheap brass trinkets I uncovered a superb gem
which has been known to the world as the Beryl
of Tartary. No one has ever known what became
of this family heirloom until now. I covered it
up again, because the time has not yet come when
I can sell it or use it myself. In a corner was
an old scimitar with plaster and mud covering its
surface. I rubbed away the filth and found upon
the handle the Seven Rubies of Persia, which one
of my ancestors won in battle. Each ruby is said
to contain a drop of blood from the heart of a
king, and whoever wields this scimitar is considered
invincible, for the spirits of the seven kings
fight for its champion. This treasure I could not
leave buried, so I have brought it to my chamber
and concealed it in the lower drawer of my cabinet.
No one now alive will know where I got it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; cried Archie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take
a look at this wonderful weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we unlocked the lower drawer and at first
could find nothing. But Archie soon saw that the
drawer was so deep that it must have a false bottom.
This was indeed the case, and when we
had pried up this false bottom with our knives,
we came upon a chamois bag in which was the
famous scimitar. It had no sheath and the Prince
had carefully polished it. Its delicately tempered
blade of blue steel was bright as a mirror. The
handle was of gold, and seven splendid rubies,
blood-red in color, were imbedded in the yellow
metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>Also in the drawer were a necklace of magnificent
pearls and a single emerald as big as a pigeon&rsquo;s egg.
These we gave to Bry to add to our
collection, but the scimitar we replaced in the
top of the drawer, where it could easily be obtained
if required. Upon examination we found
many of the compartments of the cabinet empty.
At a recent period someone&mdash;probably the Prince&mdash;had
evidently cleared it out.</p>
<p>There was more written about the wonderful
treasures in the tomb of Kai-Abon, which there
is no need to repeat in these pages. Nor were any
of the other entries in the book of especial interest
to my patient reader, although we read them
all and got a clearer idea of Prince Kai&rsquo;s inner
nature than we had ever had before. Only once
did he mention his sister, Nor Ghai, and then it
was merely to say that he intended some day to
send her to England or America to be educated
according to modern methods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>We passed the rest of the day in the examination
of this wonderful cabinet, and when evening
arrived we were undecided whether or not to
make another trip that night to the underground
vaults. Somehow I could not get that inscrutable
glassy stare of the mandarin out of my mind,
and the recollection of it seemed to trouble my
comrades as it did me.</p>
<p>We finally decided to postpone our next trip
through the underground passage until we were
prepared to carry away a portion of the treasure;
so we locked the cabinet, put the keys away and
quietly went to bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TRAP IS SPRUNG.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning we found the Chief Eunuch
quite recovered from his debauch and as keen
and attentive to his duties as ever. One of his
men had neglected his tasks while Wi-to was
under the influence of liquor, so his chief called
him into his private office and cut him down with
his own scimitar.</p>
<p>The incident created no excitement in the palace,
and when we met Wi after breakfast was over
he was as smiling and complaisant as ever. But
it taught us how little human life was valued in
this strange land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>I ventured to ask the Chief Eunuch once again
to assist me to select the ornaments for Prince
Kai&rsquo;s friends, and to my relief he consented readily.
So we walked through the state apartments
and made choice of some moderate-sized articles,
of no great value but of considerable weight.
Also I chose two teakwood chests bound in bronze,
with excellent locks, in which I said that I would
pack the books.</p>
<p>Wi-to was pleased that we were so modest in
our demands and showed no disposition to rob the
palace of its most rare and precious objects of
art. So when it came to a choice of our own
gifts the eunuch declared that he would himself
make the selection, acting as the confidential
servant of his late master, whose generous nature
he well knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send the gifts to your rooms,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and the gifts for our royal prince&rsquo;s friends shall
be brought as well; and the packing-cases as soon
as our artisans can prepare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked him, and he added, cordially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let these preparations hasten your departure,
I entreat you. It is good to have guests
in the palace. If you go away there will be nothing
for me to do but quarrel with Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>We had an appointment that afternoon to meet
the girls in the willow pavilion; so when the
hour arrived we sauntered away from the palace
and lost ourselves in the shrubbery, afterward
picking our way cautiously toward the remote
corner where the pavilion stood.</p>
<p>The girls were all assembled and eagerly awaiting
our coming, for we had promised to tell them
more about our American women, in whom they
were greatly interested, and to describe their dress
and social privileges and methods of amusement.
I suppose that to these poor secluded creatures,
who experienced so little variety in their narrow
lives, our stories sounded like fairy tales. Some
inkling of woman&rsquo;s position in our western civilization
they had gleaned from their copies of
Byron and Shakespeare, which, by the way, only
Ko-Tua had the ability to read. But the books
could not answer questions, and the pretty maids
were full of questions today, some of which we
were puzzled to answer.</p>
<p>During our several interviews our relations
with the little Chinese beauties had become so
friendly and free from constraint that they were
no longer afraid of us and we sat around the
wicker table like brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>As Joe was describing a bit of modern finery
Mai Mou exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! You can wear that when you become a
widow, Ko-Tua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A widow!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;When will that be,
Ko-Tua?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know; but before long, Sam. My
husband must soon kill himself, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard something of the sort. Will it
make you unhappy to become a widow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall be glad. I hate Mai Lo,&rdquo; she
replied, simply.</p>
<p>I glanced at Mai Mou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, little Pearl?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like my father, either,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;But I do not know him very well. Perhaps he
is better than he seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is worse,&rdquo; said Archie, positively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the time comes,&rdquo; continued Ko-Tua,
raising her big, wistful eyes, &ldquo;my husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a great start, and a look of horror
spread over her beautiful face and actually transformed
it. For her eyes had caught some object
beyond our circle, and remained fixed and dilated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Mai Mou followed her gaze and gave a little
cry that conveyed the agony of a wounded deer.
Nor Ghai stood up in her place and the smile
faded from her pallid face.</p>
<p>Of course we boys whirled around at once, and
there stood Mai Lo, just within the entrance, his
glassy stare taking us all in, his hands folded
tightly upon his broidered robe.</p>
<p>That last posture was new to me and gave me
the idea that at last the mandarin was as much
aroused as he had ever before been in his life.</p>
<p>He must have enjoyed the confusion he had
caused, for I confess that I felt as guilty as a
school-boy caught in the act of robbing an apple-orchard.</p>
<p>The discovery was so unexpected that for a
time I could hardly comprehend its import, but
presently vague thoughts of possible consequences
to these innocent girls began to pass through my
brain, and they steadied me and made me grow
angry instead of afraid. The other boys must
have felt the same way, for it was Archie who
broke the terrible silence by saying with a growl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I kill him, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>I was almost tempted to consent, but when
Archie drew his revolver and cocked it with a
cool deliberation, I put my hand on his arm and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing puzzled me. Bryonia had come with
us to a place within sight of the pavilion, where
we left him in the thicket of trees as a watch to
warn us of danger. But here was the mandarin,
and Bry was still silent. What could have become
of our faithful black?</p>
<p>Perhaps Archie&rsquo;s threatening attitude helped
to unlimber the silent Mai Lo&rsquo;s tongue, for without
altering his position he said in his calm,
monotonous tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are aware, young men, of the
penalty for this outrage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outrage!&rdquo; I cried, resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An outrage against the most sacred institution
of China&mdash;the harem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass,
Mai Lo. You&rsquo;ve traveled a little and you know
you&rsquo;re talking rot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is not America; it is Kai-Nong,&rdquo; said the
governor, grimly. &ldquo;You have violated the sanctity
of my family relations. You have disgraced
Nor Ghai, the daughter of the princely and royal
Kais. For this our laws have provided a relentless
penalty&mdash;death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; wailed the little Nor Ghai, bursting
into tears. &ldquo;You will die&mdash;you will all be sliced!
And I knew it and warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo lifted his hand and Mai Mou and
Ko-Tua crept obediently toward him with bowed
heads and passed out of the pavilion. I saw them
push through a hedge and in a flash realized why
Bryonia had not seen the approach of the governor.
We were nearer to Mai Lo&rsquo;s house than
the palace, and there was probably a gate in the
wall that had admitted the girls and the governor
from a direction opposite to that in which we
had ourselves come.</p>
<p>Nor Ghai had started to follow her companions,
but Mai Lo uttered a harsh order in Chinese
and she halted, standing like a statue.</p>
<p>The mandarin clapped his hands, and four of
his gaudily dressed soldiers burst through the
hedge and entered the pavilion, guarding its entrance,
There was no other way for us to escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Mai Lo thoughtfully took a position behind his
soldiers before he made his next move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will leave this place at once, without
a moment&rsquo;s delay, and travel straight to Shanghai,&rdquo;
he said, deliberately, &ldquo;I will spare your lives.
If not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will summon my eunuchs and have you
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; I said, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. We are not afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandarin blew a whistle, and through the
hedge leaped a band of a dozen fierce fellows
wearing the governor&rsquo;s colors of crimson and
azure. They bore naked scimitars, and at a word
from Mai Lo dashed past the soldiers and flew
toward us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Three revolvers cracked and three of the eunuchs
fell, while others stumbled over them; and as the
fellows held back, startled at such unexpected opposition,
with one accord we saw our chance to
escape. Each seized a stool and swinging it for
a weapon we leaped upon our enemies and literally
fought our way to the entrance. I tried to
see Mai Lo and brain him as a farewell token,
but the wily mandarin had taken pains to be out
of the way.</p>
<p>Once free of the imprisoning willows we fled
with all our speed toward the palace, and as soon
as they had recovered from their astonishment
the soldiers and eunuchs were after us in hot
chase.</p>
<p>Emerging from the thicket into the palace
gardens we came plump upon a rescue party, consisting
of Nux and Bry at the head of a band of
eunuchs led by Wi-to himself.</p>
<p>Our pursuers halted until the governor came
up, running with somewhat undignified haste. He
jabbered away to the Chief Eunuch, behind whose
men we had taken refuge, and Wi appeared both
astonished and embarrassed by what he heard.
Turning to me, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true? Have you forced yourselves into
the presence of Mai Lo&rsquo;s wife and daughter, and
also of the Princess Nor Ghai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why we have seen and talked with them, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;I demand the culprits,&rdquo; called Mai Lo. &ldquo;In
the name of the law, I demand them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go quick,&rdquo; whispered the Chief Eunuch,
scowling. &ldquo;Quick, for your lives, to the palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We obeyed without question, sprinting along
the paths at our best gait and urged by the loud
clamor of protesting voices behind us.</p>
<p>Bry and Nux brought up our rear more leisurely,
and Wi-to held back the mandarin&rsquo;s gang of
cut-throats until we had a good start.</p>
<p>But after we had reached our apartments and
bolted the outer door securely we had not time
fully to regain our breath before the shouts of our
pursuers were heard in the halls and passages.</p>
<p>The noise calmed down presently, and after
several minutes a sharp rap came at our door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I; admit me!&rdquo; said the voice of the
Chief Eunuch.</p>
<p>Joe opened the door, but bolted it again as
soon as Wi-to had stalked into the room.</p>
<p>The eunuch gazed upon each of us in turn
with black looks. Then he said, slowly and bitterly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the name of Buddha, have you done
the one thing that has forfeited my right to protect
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we?&rdquo; I asked, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he snapped, grinding his teeth savagely.
&ldquo;You are doomed. Even my power cannot save
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FEARFUL ENCOUNTER.</span></h2>
<p>I have always believed Wi-to was the best
friend we had in Kai-Nong, and that he was quite
willing to serve us to the best of his ability, thus
honoring the will of his dead master. But his
oriental education and surroundings had saturated
his otherwise liberal mind with the conventions
and prejudices of his people; and he had a supreme
contempt for women and could not tolerate
such an unwarranted act as we had committed;
in other words, making the acquaintance of three
pretty and interesting girls who were inmates of
harems.</p>
<p>So Wi-to stormed and paced the floor, in one
breath condemning us to horrible tortures and
in the next trying to figure out a way to save us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Meantime we, the culprits, maintained an appearance
subdued and expectant, but could not
bring ourselves to realize that we had merited
punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not give you up to Mai Lo,&rdquo; declared
the Chief Eunuch, positively; &ldquo;but he has the
right to send his men to capture you. For a time
I can hold him at bay, but such delay cannot save
you. If I provided for your escape from the palace,
which I might easily do, you could not cross
the province ruled by Mai Lo, and his influence
as governor of Kwang-Kai-Nong extends more
or less throughout the Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mai Lo now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has returned to his house. But his soldiers
are left to guard the exits of the palace, and they
are ordered to capture you alive or dead. It is an
insult to me to invade my territory in this way,
and had you been guilty of any other crime I
could have driven away the slaves of the governor.
But a violation of the sanctity of the harem is so
serious that our laws allow the criminals to be
taken wherever they seek refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been near the harem,&rdquo; protested
Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your action is worse. You met the women
clandestinely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are not foreigners sometimes introduced to
Chinese women by their lords?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sometimes done in the coast cities, such
as Shanghai and Hong-Kong; but never where
the ancient laws of our Empire prevail,&rdquo; said the
eunuch. &ldquo;Besides, only the master of the harem
can demand the death penalty for its violation;
so, had Mai Lo introduced you to his wife and
daughter, you would have had nothing to fear.
As it is, the old serpent will have your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we can help it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What would
you advise us to do, Wi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paced up and down for a time in deep
thought. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your only hope is to escape from Kai-Nong.
Perhaps the governor will not care to follow you,
once you are out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go until we have carried out the
wishes of Prince Kai,&rdquo; I returned, stubbornly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that very easily and quickly.&rdquo;
He cast his eyes around the room and noticed
the ashes of the burnt paper in the brazier. &ldquo;I
see you have examined the cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other work need not take you long,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;I will at once send the ornaments
and cases here to your room, and you may pack
them at your leisure. Then my men will carry
them for you to the border of Kwang-Kai-Nong,
and there await your coming. They will arouse
no suspicion, and you must disguise yourselves
and travel separately to the meeting place. The
signet ring of the House of Kai will doubtless
protect you from interference on the journey. So,
while the governor&rsquo;s men are still guarding the
exits of the palace, you will be on your way out
of the country. Yes! That is a good plan to
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we get away if Mai Lo guards
all the exits?&rdquo; inquired Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is my secret. No one knows this
palace as I do. There are secret ways of which
the governor does not dream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>This statement made me uneasy until I remembered
that Prince Kai had assured me that the
private passage to the underground vaults was unknown
to any member of his household but himself.</p>
<p>To gain time we agreed to the suggestion of
Wi-to, and the eunuch went away to issue his
commands.</p>
<p>Before long all the ornaments, the two chests,
and the packing-cases had been brought to our
rooms and placed at our disposal. Also Wi-to
sent our own gifts, and I was pleased to find that
he had selected some exquisite ivory carvings that
were of great artistic value. Perhaps they were
worth more than all the other things we had
chosen, and I was delighted at the evidence of the
Chief Eunuch&rsquo;s good will.</p>
<p>Our evening meal was served in our rooms as
usual, and was as sumptuous as ever; but we had
not our usual appetites and were glad when the
dragging, ceremonious meal was ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to make
a trip to the vaults tonight and bring back all the
treasure we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>That was inevitable; so we waited patiently
until midnight and then removed our shoes and
stole softly down the passage to the dragon tapestry.
We took Bry with us and left Nux to guard
our rooms.</p>
<p>Being now acquainted with the way we proceeded
more quickly than on the first occasion
and were soon treading the damp and musty tunnel
leading to the tombs.</p>
<p>When we reached the alcove of the first Kai we
looked for Joe&rsquo;s handkerchief and found that it
had been removed from the grating. This was
no more than we had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is to go straight to the
alcove of the seventh Kai, old Abon, which the
Prince&rsquo;s book declares is the richest of all. We&rsquo;ll
get that big beryl, for one thing, and anything
else that seems especially valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Archie, unfastening the grating.
&ldquo;It must be the seventh alcove to the left
of this, for those on the right are still vacant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe started first and I came next with the lamp.
Archie and Bry were just behind me. Suddenly
we all stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>From out of the darkness of the vast domed
chamber a harsh cry smote our ears and we heard
a rush of footsteps toward us.</p>
<p>Spellbound, we stood peering into the gloom,
expecting we knew not what. And then into the
dim circle of light made by our lamp there
bounded a huge gray form, which like a catapult
hurled itself upon Joe.</p>
<p>I gave a scream of fear, and the cry went echoing
through the great dome like the roar of a
multitude. For in a flash I realized what had
happened. The great ape, Fo-Chu&mdash;the man-eater&mdash;had
been loosed upon us.</p>
<p>The body of the ferocious beast beat Joe down
as if he had been a feather, and sent him sprawling
upon the floor. But at the same time the ape,
blinded by the violence of its own onslaught,
struck its head with terrific force against a grating
and rolled over again and again before it could
recover itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Instantly Bry seized Joe in his strong arms and
fled back to the alcove we had just left, and Archie
and I were but an instant behind. Yet so active
was the great ape that, just as I pulled the grating
to behind me, he made a second leap, and the
weight of his body against the bronze bars sent
me plunging head foremost into the alcove. The
lamp flew from my hand and was extinguished,
while in my fall I threw down one of the vases
and its contents scattered themselves over the floor
and rained around me like hailstones.</p>
<p>It was Archie who had presence of mind to
throw the catch in place that secured the grating,
and so protect us from Fo-Chu, who raged and
beat upon the bars in his desire to reach us.</p>
<p>In the darkness I struggled to my feet, while
Bry lighted a match and recovered the lamp,
which, being metal, was not broken. Not much
oil had been spilled, and when the flame from the
wick flared up we looked at each other to see what
damage had been done. The blood was streaming
from a cut in my cheek and Joe had a bump upon
his forehead as big as a goose-egg; but when
we glanced at the horrible visage of the Sacred
Ape, who clung fast to the outside of the grating
and regarded us with evil eyes and vicious bared
teeth, we were thankful enough that we had escaped
so lightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is another item of account against Mai
Lo,&rdquo; growled Archie, staring at the beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, while Bry bound up my cut with
a handkerchief; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy enough to explain this
little surprise. The governor is keeper of the
Sacred Apes, and discovering that we knew a
way to enter the vaults he loosed the old man-killer
in them, expecting the ape to make an end
of us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He nearly succeeded,&rdquo; said Joe, tenderly feeling
of his bruise. &ldquo;I thought when old Fo-Chu
struck me that my game was up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to do now?&rdquo; demanded Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take what is in this alcove and be satisfied,&rdquo;
I suggested, shuddering as I glanced at
the ape and met its cruel gaze.</p>
<p>Silently we began to gather up the scattered
gems that littered the floor. Bryonia had brought
along a strip of tapestry from our rooms, and
we spread this upon the tiles and placed the gems
upon it in a glittering heap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>We took such pearls, rubies and emeralds as
seemed of good size and color, but the jade and
golden ornaments were too clumsy and big to
be utilized. When we had emptied the jars and
vases we had a princely fortune piled upon the
cloth, yet it did not satisfy us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Prince Kai had robbed this alcove
already,&rdquo; remarked Joe, &ldquo;and there is so much to
be had in the other places that I hate to go back
and call this a night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do?&rdquo; I asked, eyeing the
great ape who still clung to the bars of the grating
and fiercely watched our every movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the beast!&rdquo; exclaimed Archie, and
threw a small emerald at the brute.</p>
<p>The jewel missed him and fell in the domed
chamber. In a flash Fo-Chu bounded after it,
caught it in his claws, and examined it with almost
human shrewdness. Then he sprang at the
grating again, and clung there as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;I believe we can capture
the ape and get him out of the way for good.
Shall we risk it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>When he explained his plan we thought it was
worth a trial. On looking around we found a
chain necklace, with heavy links of gold set with
gems. Joe stood before the grating and waved
the necklace just out of reach of the beast&rsquo;s hand,
tantalizing old Fo-Chu until he grew furious and
shook the bars with fierce energy.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Joe released the necklace and
sent it flying far into the chamber.</p>
<p>With a bound the ape was after it, and Joe
released the catch and skipped out of our alcove
in an instant, running to the next grating to the
right, which he opened before Fo-Chu discovered
he had been tricked. But seeing Joe standing
quietly at the next alcove the beast uttered a
snarl and with savage impetuosity hurled his huge
body straight at his proposed victim. Joe slid
behind the wall and allowed the ape to fall sprawling
within the alcove. The next instant the
boy was outside, slamming the grating to and
springing the catch.</p>
<p>We who had watched this bold trick with bated
breath now uttered a cry of joy and dashed out of
our retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tables are turned,&rdquo; said Joe, panting a
little from his exertions. &ldquo;You are now our
prisoner, Fo-Chu.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>The ape realized it and with blood-curdling
yelps was furiously testing the bars in his effort to
escape. But they held securely and we knew we
were safe.</p>
<p>The only danger was that the beast would discover
the method of releasing the catch; but Bry
happened to have a small Yale lock in his pocket,
so we unearthed a heavy bronze chain from one
of the alcoves, and by tossing an object inside
the niche induced Fo-Chu to dive for it. This
gave us a chance to snap the lock through its
links.</p>
<p>Knowing we were now masters of the situation
we proceeded to the tomb of Kai Abon and examined
it with care. It yielded us about two quarts
of superb rubies, besides three dozen magnificent
pearls and the great beryl. From there we visited
the place where Mai Lo had been assorting
his jewels, but found he had removed the heap
and secreted his treasure elsewhere. The vault of
the third Kai, however, contained a vast store of
fine gems, and after we had secured these and
added them to the treasure already acquired, we
were well satisfied with the result of our night&rsquo;s
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>Before we returned along the passage we went
to take another look at the Sacred Ape. He was
squatting upon the floor of his alcove, motionless
but alert, and by the lamplight I thought his eyes
glowed like two great rubies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BATTLE IN THE CORRIDOR.</span></h2>
<p>When we reached our rooms and behind bolted
doors examined the contents of the tapestry curtain,
we were amazed at the splendor of the
treasure we had obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t on board the <i>Seagull</i> yet,&rdquo; Joe
reminded us, and we sighed regretfully as we realized
the truth of this statement. Nux took charge
of the booty and then we all went to bed and tried
to sleep; but on my part the attempt was not very
successful. I wakened every little while with a
start to see the glowing eyes of the great ape
regarding me from the darkness, or the great
gray body hurtling through the air to fall upon
me; and my cheek pained me from the deep gash
it had received.</p>
<p>So I slept but fitfully until daybreak, when I
rose to find Archie and Joe already up and
Bryonia making coffee over an alcohol stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>Our first care was to dispose of the jewels,
and this we did by tearing the leaves out of some
of the books of Prince Kai, a big heap of which
had been sent us by the eunuch, and wrapping
the gems in them. Afterward we packed two
boxes with them and nailed on the covers. To
carry out the deception we had planned, we next
concealed in the empty drawers of the cabinet
enough ornaments to have filled the two boxes.</p>
<p>So far our work had progressed very well, and
we had just finished breakfast and were congratulating
ourselves on our progress when our
eunuch Tun ran in and told us that the governor&rsquo;s
troops had been ordered to advance upon
our retreat and capture us in our rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for Wi-to at once,&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
<p>The eunuch hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can,&rdquo; he said, with downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Archie, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wi-to no see anybody,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar! He isn&rsquo;t drunk again, is he?&rdquo;
I cried, recalling with sudden fear what such a
calamity would mean to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>The fellow was loyal to his chief and would
not confess the truth; but it was not hard to
guess. It occurred to me that his annoyance
over our trouble about the women had sent him
upon another spree, fast upon the heels of the last
one. But the loss of the Chief Eunuch&rsquo;s protection
was a serious thing to us just then, and evidently
Mai Lo, having heard the news, had decided
to order an attack at once, a thing he would
not otherwise have dared do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we barricade the door?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a better plan than that,&rdquo; replied Joe, who
was a thoughtful fellow and full of resource.
&ldquo;Let us stand in the passage outside and shoot
down any one who turns the corner by the dragon
tapestry. There are two reasons for adopting
this plan. One is that we can reserve the use
of the secret panel in case we want to get to the
vaults by way of the underground passage, and
the other is that we can retire into our rooms as
a last resort and bolt the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that case we&rsquo;d be like rats in a trap,&rdquo;
added Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>I saw the wisdom of Joe&rsquo;s proposal and at
once sent our two blacks with revolvers to hold
the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to shoot,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our
lives against theirs, and if they find we mean
business they may decide to let us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nux and Bry grinned approvingly and took
their stand in the passage, while we remained to
discuss the situation.</p>
<p>Presently we heard the crack of pistols and
howls of rage, and gained the passage in time to
see the governor&rsquo;s soldiers come crowding around
the bend while our blacks discharged their
weapons with cool aim and telling effect.</p>
<p>The foremost wanted to draw back when they
met with opposition, but those behind, who could
not see what was happening, pushed them along
by main force, and so dense was the pack of
crimson and azure tunics that Nux and Bry could
not fire without hitting some of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>But there was another danger&mdash;that their very
numbers would defeat us if they obtained the
advantage; so we all joined in the scrimmage and
poured a hail of bullets into the foe. Those who
fell literally blocked the bend in the passage, and
at last their cries were heeded by those in the
rear and the mob surged back and disappeared
from sight.</p>
<p>We could hear their loud jabbering for a few
minutes and then from the sounds we knew they
had all retreated to the lower hall of the passage.</p>
<p>Presently a head slid slowly into view, which
we recognized as that of Tun. The eunuch signalled
to us not to shoot, and then ran up to ask
if the soldiers could remove their dead and
wounded. We gave permission at once and then
stood on guard while the fallen were dragged
away.</p>
<p>Pretty soon Tun came back to say that there
would be no further attack until the soldiers could
find their governor and get from him further
orders. Just now Mai Lo was nowhere to be
found.</p>
<p>So we left Bry alone in the passage and sat
down in our room to talk over our predicament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>Now it seems that just beyond the main doorway
that led into our suite of rooms this length
of passage abruptly ended, and as it was hung
with tapestry we supposed it was a blank wall.
But as Bry paced up and down he was astonished
to see the tapestry move. Then it was pushed
aside and a lovely girl emerged and signalled to
him by placing her finger over her lips.</p>
<p>Our man understood and was discreet enough
to show the girl into our reception-room without
a word. We sprang up amazed when Nor Ghai
stood before us, her hands crossed upon her
breast and her head bobbing with courtesies in a
comical fashion. But as I looked at her I saw
her eyes were red with weeping; so I took her
hand and said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, little friend? Have they dared to
harm you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she replied, hastily. &ldquo;Wi-to
has but told me not to leave the palace. It is not
for myself I weep, but for my poor companions,&rdquo;
and she broke down and sobbed bitterly.</p>
<p>We three fellows looked uncomfortably enough
at this exhibition of female misery, and did not
know how to comfort Nor Ghai.</p>
<p>So to hide our embarrassment, Archie demanded
in a rough voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;What has old Death&rsquo;s-Head been doing to
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who mean you?&rdquo; sobbed Nor Ghai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the gov&rsquo;nor, of course, Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him&mdash;him has took away all their jewels and
silks an&rsquo; clothe poor Ko-Tua an&rsquo; Mai Mou in
black cotton. An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; with fresh sobs&mdash;&ldquo;tomorrow
him say him cut out both their tongues
for talk with foreign devils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little maid, in her misery, wasn&rsquo;t doing
very well with her English; but we understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old scoundrel!&rdquo; cried Archie, greatly
shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t allow this, boys,&rdquo; said Joe, with
decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it strikes me we&rsquo;re in rather bad shape
to interfere,&rdquo; I suggested, regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> interfere,&rdquo; declared Archie. &ldquo;We
got these girls into this trouble by our rashness,
and we must get &rsquo;em out of it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also got ourselves into trouble,&rdquo; I
reminded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re men and they&rsquo;re just girls, and helpless
in this heathen country. We&rsquo;ve got to hunt up
Mai Lo and stop this little game before it&rsquo;s too
late. If we can&rsquo;t save the treasure and the girls
both, let the treasure go to blazes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor Ghai looked at him gratefully, and Archie
gave him a sounding whack on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the governor?&rdquo; I asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not. But Ko-Tua, she run away and
come to me, with Mai Mou. They in my harem
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s better than finding the governor,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them go home again, Nor
Ghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help. The eunuchs will take them,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s only one thing to be done,&rdquo; I
announced, gravely. &ldquo;They must come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;If they do
that, Mai Lo cut off their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get a chance,&rdquo; said Archie; &ldquo;or if
he does, he&rsquo;ll have to cut off our heads too.
Bring your friends here, Nor Ghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, looking from one to the other of
us in bewilderment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, little friend,&rdquo; said I, gently.
&ldquo;Go and fetch Ko-Tua and Mai Mou to us. In
that way alone can you possibly save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded brightly, smiling through her
tears, and tripped away.</p>
<p>We watched the passage an hour; two hours.
Then we began to fear that Nor Ghai had in
some way been prevented from returning. But
no; she appeared, finally, leading the governor&rsquo;s
girl wife and daughter by either hand, and then
she explained that she had much trouble in
inducing her friends to accept our protection.</p>
<p>To them the governor of Kwang-Kai-Nong
was a mighty power, and they feared to defy his
authority by seeking the protection of three boys
who were foreigners and themselves fighting for
their lives.</p>
<p>Indeed, when I came to consider the matter
from this point of view, I was surprised that
Nor Ghai had succeeded in winning them over.</p>
<p>But here they were, finally, and Ko-Tua said
to us in her simple way:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;With no tongue a woman could not live
happy, could she? So we do not care if we lose
our lives. We come to you and trust you, for
Nor Ghai says Wi-to is your servant, and Wi-to
is almost as great as Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had my doubts of Wi-to&rsquo;s usefulness to us
at this juncture, but did not express them. As
well as we could we impressed the maids with
the fact that we were not beaten yet and intended
to put up a good fight to the last. Nor Ghai
told us that the news of our defeat of the soldiers
had already reached the harem, and had
caused the condemned girls to decide to place
themselves under our protection.</p>
<p>We had Nux lead Ko-Tua and Mai Mou to the
further chamber of our suite, and when they had
entered we ordered the black to stand at the door
and guard them.</p>
<p>Nor Ghai thanked us and went back to her
harem. She said she was in no danger, as no
one had authority to punish her except Wi-to.
There would be a hunt for Ko-Tua and Mai
Mou presently, but only Nor Ghai knew the secret
entrance to our corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>When she had gone we felt our responsibilities
overpowering us, and tried to concoct some plan
to force old Mai Lo to pardon his wife and
daughter. If we could not do that we must
carry them away with us to Shanghai; but in that
case they would double our danger and we should
not know what to do with them after they were
safe out of Kwang-Kai-Nong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Sam,&rdquo; remarked Archie, after we had
been thinking it over for a long time, &ldquo;this is
one of those bridges you&rsquo;re always talking about.
Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s cross it till we come to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After luncheon, which Tun and his helpers
served as usual, we passed an anxious and dreary
afternoon. Tun had informed us that the captain
of the soldiers had still been unable to locate
the governor to get his commands, and seemed
unwilling to attack us again without further
orders. Also we gleaned the information in a
roundabout way that Wi was still shut up in his
room under the influence of a strong drink
brewed from rice.</p>
<p>About three o&rsquo;clock Archie slapped his leg and
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie Mai Lo is in the vaults sorting
treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure of it,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; proposed Joe, after a pause,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s go down and find him, and have it out with
the old rascal in the tombs of the ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s offer to divide with him. There&rsquo;s
enough for us all. Who cares what becomes of
the governor&mdash;whether he suicides or not&mdash;so
long as we get out of this infernal country and
back to Shanghai with our share of the plunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a clever idea, Joe!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use fighting if a peaceable arrangement
can be made. Why haven&rsquo;t we thought of
making a bargain with Mai Lo before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take us long to prepare for the trip.
The passage was still deserted, but it was necessary
to leave both Nux and Bry to guard the
entrance to the rooms, and the girls.</p>
<p>So we three boys crept to the dragon tapestry,
passed the secret panel without being discovered
and soon were creeping along the tunnel for the
third time on our way to the chih of the
Ancestors of Kai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>I carried with me the famous scimitar we had
found in the cabinet&mdash;the one with the seven
great rubies set in the hilt. For our ammunition
was getting low, and if we found a need to use
weapons in our present adventure the scimitar
might prove very handy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE VENGEANCE OF THE RUBY SCIMITAR.</span></h2>
<p>I think we had all forgotten that the King Ape
had been left imprisoned in the vaults. But when
we entered the first alcove from the tunnel and
heard the monster barking and growling in the
recess at our right, the presence of the beast was
recalled to us very forcibly. We paid little attention
to the ape just then, however, for we were
eager to discover whether or not the governor
was really in the ancestral vaults.</p>
<p>As we passed from behind the tapestry we put
out our lamp, each of us holding a few matches
in our hands to use in case of emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>The blackness was now intense, and as we crept
stealthily in single file toward the gate the gloom
seemed to press upon us and embrace us. Likewise
the silence of the immense vaults, which had
been hewn out of solid rock beneath the great
mound, was oppressive; for while the jabbering
of the King Ape and his violent shaking of his
grating at times reverberated through the dome
with a thousand echoes, the hush of death that
otherwise pervaded the place was but rendered
the more effective.</p>
<p>On the occasions of our former visits I had
looked upon these chih as mere treasure-houses;
now, moving silently through the darkness, I
suddenly realized we were in a place of the dead,
with many generations of warriors, princes and
imperial viceroys lying in state in their heretofore
inviolable tombs. Would not the spirits of
these great ancestors of Kai resent our intrusion?
Spirits! I gave a start at the recollection
of a remark Kai Lun Pu had made on his deathbed:
&ldquo;If I find that I possess a spirit I shall try
to watch you, and enjoy the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not usually nervous, but I admit that when
I recalled this significant speech I shuddered and
grasped the scimitar of Kai Abon more tightly in
my hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in thunder&rsquo;s the matter with you, Sam?&rdquo;
growled Archie, who had his hand on my
shoulder.</p>
<p>I did not care to say; but just then Joe, who
was in advance of me, touched the grating and
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the gate&mdash;stop a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unfastened the catch and we passed into
the great domed hall.</p>
<p>On our right came a sudden rattling of the
bars, where the monster ape was still struggling
to escape his prison. I reflected that he must
be getting hungry by this time, and hunger would
make him more ferocious than ever. But our
first impulse was to peer anxiously around the
great chamber to discover if any light indicated
the presence of Mai Lo.</p>
<p>There it was! a faint glimmer coming from
one of the alcoves far to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; muttered Archie, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s here, all right,&rdquo; I replied in a low
tone, &ldquo;but in order to reach the place we must
creep along the wall, so as not to get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead, then,&rdquo; said Joe, and started feeling
his way by keeping one hand on the tapestry
hangings that separated the various alcoves.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a violent rattling of metal
near at hand and Joe stopped so abruptly that I
ran into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows; we can&rsquo;t pass this alcove,&rdquo;
warned Joe. &ldquo;That infernal monkey might reach
out and grab us if we came too near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light the lamp,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and hold it under
your coat. Mai Lo is in an alcove and he&rsquo;s too
busy to notice us at this distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe obeyed. As the light of the wick illuminated
our surroundings we found we had halted
none too soon. The huge ape had his body
pressed close to the grating, which, to our astonishment,
we saw was now a mass of twisted and
bent metal, so loosened and displaced by the constant
wrenching of the powerful beast that only
the chain and lock with which we had fastened
it seemed to hold the grating in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be out of there before long,&rdquo; remarked
Joe, half fearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must dive into some alcove,&rdquo; I suggested.
&ldquo;But I guess the bars will hold until
we&rsquo;ve had our talk with Mai Lo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circling around the place so as to avoid the
reach of the ape&rsquo;s long arms we came to the
tapestries beyond his den and continued our
progress, extinguishing the light as we drew
nearer to the alcove from whence came the
glimmer we had first observed.</p>
<p>We walked with stealthy tread and stood before
the alcove without a sound of our approach
having been noted.</p>
<p>The grating had been set wide open and held
from swinging to by a big vase set against it.
In the center of the alcove a light burned upon a
low taboret, and near it squatted Mai Lo, absorbed
in selecting and arranging a mass of jewels piled
up before him.</p>
<p>So occupied was the governor with this pleasant
task that he never looked up until after we
had entered and stood in a silent row before him.</p>
<p>Then his body gave a twitch beneath his
broidered robes, but his passive face showed no
expression at all. Perhaps it was incapable of
expression. Even the eyes had no more animation
beneath their surfaces than shoe-buttons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you have escaped,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was nothing to escape,&rdquo; I answered
with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guards surrounded you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tried to, but there were not enough of
them. And they are fewer in number now than
they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at us without reply; without altering
his position. He even rubbed the ruby that
was in his hand against the satin of his sleeve as
if to polish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t all this nonsense gone far enough, Mai
Lo?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;Are you not getting tired of
opposing us when you know we can defy your
power and carry out our plans without your
consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He calmly lowered his gaze and began to
polish the ruby again. From the distant alcove
where Fo-Chu was confined came the ape&rsquo;s horrid
growls and the shaking of the bars; but the governor
seemed little interested in anything but the
heap of plunder before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have tried in various ways to destroy
us,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;You set your eunuchs on us
in the pavilion; you ordered your soldiers to cut
us down in the palace; you loosed the King Ape
in these vaults to tear us to pieces. But what is
the result? We are here still, and free, and
masters of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai Lo slipped the ruby in his pocket and took
another from the heap before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you enter the Ancestral Chih?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;My soldiers guard every avenue of
approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some things it is not necessary for
you to know,&rdquo; I retorted; &ldquo;and that is one of
them. But we did not come here to quarrel, but
to make peace with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to interest him, for he transferred
his beady gaze from the gems to my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This constant opposition is annoying,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;and while Prince Kai Lun Pu gave to
us the riches contained in these vaults, and showed
us how to secure them, we find there is more than
we need, or can carry back with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Kai had no right to give you the
wealth of his ancestors,&rdquo; said Mai Lo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Neither have you any right to
rob the Ancestral Halls. Instead, you ought to
seal them up, and commit suicide. But you won&rsquo;t
do that. You want to escape with enough treasure
to make you rich for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded me intently, but made no reply.
So I went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not care whether you escape or kill
yourself, except that by working together, instead
of in opposition, we may all succeed in getting
away with the treasure. There&rsquo;s more than
enough for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still he made no reply. From the dome came
a sudden crash of metal and the wild yelp of the
giant ape. But we all stood motionless, wrapped
in the importance of the governor&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it to be&mdash;war or peace?&rdquo; I
asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;You are miserable
foreign pigs, and I will kill you. Not one gem
of this treasure shall you carry away. Your
knowledge of these chih has sealed your doom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>I felt like striking the rascal with the naked
scimitar I held&mdash;the scimitar for which the seven
kings fought whose life-blood was contained in
the seven rubies. But I resisted the temptation,
while Archie exclaimed: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Mai
Lo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your obstinacy may ruin us all,&rdquo; Joe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t intend to be killed,&rdquo; I observed,
bitterly; &ldquo;and you ought to know that by this
time. We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped short with a thrill of horror, for a
sudden pattering of feet reached my ears. The
governor sprang up just as we three with one
accord shrank back against the wall, and the next
instant the King Ape bounded into the alcove,
his eyes like balls of fire, his grinning teeth bared
viciously.</p>
<p>Mai Lo alone confronted the beast, who faced
his victim chattering with an almost human expression
of cruel joy. I saw the mandarin feel in
his breast and draw out a glittering poniard, while
his eyes fastened themselves upon those of the
ape. An instant more and the brute sprang
forward and caught Mai Lo in his embrace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Once, twice, I saw the keen blade bury itself
in the hairy breast of Fo-Chu. Then the monster,
with a shriek of mingled rage and agony, thrust
the man from him and bounded back against me,
the sudden movement sending me reeling against
the wall. As I fell I extended my arm in which
I still clasped the ruby scimitar, and in a flash the
ape had snatched the weapon from my hand and
with renewed screams swung it in a gleaming
circle around his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>But his attention was distracted from us, who
stood motionless with fear, toward the form of
the governor, who was rising from the place
where he had fallen. And Fo-Chu remembered
that the great pain in his breast had been caused
by the weapon of Mai Lo. So with a wild cry he
leaped forward and swung the scimitar with tremendous
power. It caught Mai Lo just above
the shoulders, and the rarely tempered blade
sheared through bone and muscle. The head
toppled with a dreadful thud to the pavement,
while for an instant the body stood erect and
swaying. Then it fell in a heap, and with a
screech that chilled my very blood with horror,
the monster threw himself upon the body and rent
it limb from limb with a fury that was absolutely
devilish. The cracking bones and tearing flesh
sickened me so that for the first time in my life I
fainted, losing all sense of danger and surroundings
as I sank limply to the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SEVERED HEAD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Sam,&rdquo; said Archie, vigorously
shaking me. &ldquo;Sit up, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, opening my eyes to gaze fearfully
around me. The lamp on the taboret still burned
steadily and crouching motionless upon the mangled
remains of Mai Lo was the form of the giant
ape. Joe and Archie supported me to my feet,
peering into my face anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is he dead?&rdquo; I asked in a faint voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead as nails!&rdquo; declared Archie, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Old Fo-Chu has saved us a lot of trouble, while
the governor kindly saved us from the beast by
giving Fo-Chu his quietus. It couldn&rsquo;t have been
better if we had planned it; but my! wasn&rsquo;t it a
jolly fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was awful, boys!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>&ldquo;The horror of it nearly got me, too,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;But, as Archie says, it was a fortunate
thing for us, take it all in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat restored in strength I
stooped down and picked up the scimitar, which
lay where the ape had dropped it. The blade
was reeking with warm blood, and I hastily
wiped it clean with the rich tapestry that hung
upon the wall of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seven kings must have fought for the
scimitar that time,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;It was a fearful
blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together we rolled the great body of the dead
ape over, with the idea of getting together the
remains of Mai Lo. But the nauseating heap of
flesh, mingled with shreds of the broidered robes
that had enveloped it, was so repulsive that we
decided not to touch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him with the ancestors of Kai,&rdquo; advised
Joe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be away from here before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never enter this place again!&rdquo; I declared,
with a shudder, for my nerves were still on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Joe, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get all we want now,&rdquo; suggested
Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>We did. Without fear of further interruption
we explored such alcoves as we had not previously
visited and appropriated the best of the
treasure they contained. We were all fairly well
loaded when at last we returned to the scene of
the recent tragedy, where we added the heap of
jewels that Mai Lo had been examining. There
was no time to assort them, so we took them all.</p>
<p>Archie seized the scimitar and hacked away a
section of the tapestry, and while I wondered
what he was going to do he picked up the severed
head of Mai Lo by its queue and dropped it into
the cloth, gathering up the corners to form a bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo; I asked, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s proof that the governor is extinct,&rdquo;
he said, with a grin. &ldquo;No one is allowed to enter
this place, so we must establish the demise of our
dearly detested enemy in the upper world. Are
you fellows ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said, picking up my burdens.</p>
<p>We returned to the alcove of the first Kai and
for the last time crept behind the tapestry and
emerged into the tunnel through the steel door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>Silently we plodded along the incline, for the
dreadful sight we had witnessed and the repulsive
burden Archie carried in his left hand depressed
us in spite of our attempt to appear cheerful.</p>
<p>As we reached the flight of steps leading to the
palace, Joe, who bore the lamp, turned to me and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to take that thing home with you,
Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I remembered I was carrying the ruby
scimitar. As I looked upon it a horror of the
weapon suddenly took possession of me. I set
down my bundles, snapped the blade across my
knee, close to the handle, and cast the ancient bit
of steel upon the ground. The golden hilt, set
with the seven rubies of the kings, I slipped into
my pocket. It is the one prize of those I secured
in Kai-Nong that I have never parted with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>By the time we reached our rooms we found
that twilight had fallen. Bry met us at the door
with the information that no one had disturbed
him during our absence. We placed our burdens
in a corner and covered them with a cloth, afterward
retiring to our rooms to wash the grime
from our hands and faces.</p>
<p>Tun came in shortly to ask if he should serve
dinner, and told us that Wi-to was &ldquo;better now&rdquo;
and would be &ldquo;alle light&rdquo; by morning.</p>
<p>We had little appetite for the meal, but made
an attempt to eat. The exciting events of the
past few days were beginning to tell upon us and
there was little hope of relaxing the nervous
tension until our strange adventure had been
accomplished.</p>
<p>The death of Mai Lo had simplified matters
very much. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;we are accused
of his murder; in which case our goose is cooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I brought the head,&rdquo; remarked
Archie, glancing at the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you ought not to have brought
it,&rdquo; I objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must have peace and the good will of
the natives in order to get away safely with the
treasure,&rdquo; he replied, sensibly enough. &ldquo;Mai Lo
has committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my boy. It was up to him to make
away with himself, thus doing his duty and fulfilling
the expectations of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell me, Archie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how
we can convince the people that Mai Lo cut off
his own head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, tell &rsquo;em the truth,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Tell
them Mai Lo gave the Sacred Ape a scimitar and
fought a duel with him. That would be a neat
way to suicide and appeal to their artistic sense.
The ape got in the first swipe and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the head to prove it,&rdquo; he answered
triumphantly.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, old man. Such an absurd story,
coming from us, his enemies, would be enough
to condemn us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat thinking over the situation for a time,
and then Joe exclaimed abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it! We will get Wi-to to tell the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; I said, relieved. &ldquo;He ought to
be sober enough to act the part tomorrow. But
in the meantime what are we to do with the governor&rsquo;s
wife and daughter? They are in no further
danger, so we needn&rsquo;t keep them cooped up
in that room any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for them,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>So we asked Nux to summon the two maids,
and soon they toddled timidly into our presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ko-Tua,&rdquo; said I, solemnly, &ldquo;you may go home
and put on your widow&rsquo;s gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you mean, Sam?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your respected husband, the admirable
old villain Mai Lo, has had the kindness to
commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, oh!&rdquo; cried both the girls, with one voice;
and then to our amazement they plumped down
upon their knees and bowed their heads to the
floor and began wailing and beating their front
hair with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>We allowed their emotions full play for a
time, but they kept up the monotonous cries and
self-inflicted blows longer than we thought
necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, Ko-Tua!&rdquo; grunted Archie, stooping
down to give the pretty widow&rsquo;s shoulder a
vigorous shake. &ldquo;Stop the racket until you&rsquo;re in
public. You&rsquo;re not so eternally sorry, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a smile and slowly rose,
Mai Mou demurely following her example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; said Ko-Tua, frankly. &ldquo;Now I no
have tongue cut out. But Mai Lo my husban&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; he dead, an&rsquo;&mdash;oh, oh! ah-oh! oh-ah!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! cut it out!&rdquo; yelled Archie, as the widow
relapsed into her wails. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t behave,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bring Mai Lo to life again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure he dead?&rdquo; inquired Mai Mou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely sure,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He committed
suicide, and we saw him do it. But see here,
young ladies; you mustn&rsquo;t mention this till tomorrow,
when public announcement is made. Do
you understand? Go home and control your grief
until you hear the news from others, and then
howl as much as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were puzzled at this order, but when we
explained that our own lives depended upon their
silence they willingly promised to obey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>At first we were all unable to figure out how
they were to return to their homes without being
seen and causing gossip; but Bry proposed that
he should rap upon the door at the end of the
passage and see if he could not arouse Nor Ghai.</p>
<p>The rapping had no effect for a time, and after
a few attempts we abandoned that idea and tried
to think of something else. Meantime, as our
dinner-table still stood piled with eatables, we
prevailed upon Ko-Tua and Mai Mou to satisfy
their hunger, which they did with ardor but
exquisite daintiness, smiling at us happily as they
ate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; whispered Archie, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d known
Mai Lo&rsquo;s death could cause so much pleasure I&rsquo;d
have asked him to commit suicide long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, without warning, Nor Ghai glided
into the room and took in the scene with one
comprehensive glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the knock, but could not come then,
as I was not alone,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Is there
something you wish me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might take these girls into your harem
and keep them there,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mai Lo&rsquo;s eunuchs will find them!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; there is nothing to fear. Mai Lo
is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she repeated, clasping her little hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has committed suicide,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Mai Lo never suicide,&rdquo; she declared,
positively. &ldquo;If Mai Lo dead, somebody kill
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody did,&rdquo; I replied, smiling at her
shrewd knowledge of the governor&rsquo;s character.
&ldquo;It was the Sacred Ape, Fo-Chu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Fo-Chu is escaped and lost. I heard it
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mai Lo found him, and thought it was
a good time to shuffle off his mortal coil. You
remember that in Shakespeare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mai Lo shuffled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice, Nor Ghai?&rdquo; asked the widow,
delightedly. Then with a sudden thought:
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;oo! ah-oo! ah&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Ko-Tua,&rdquo; warned Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her tongue!&rdquo; gasped Nor Ghai.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s quite safe; but she isn&rsquo;t supposed to
use it for wailing except in public. Take her to
your rooms, little one, and don&rsquo;t fear for her or
Mai Mou any longer. Your troubles are nearly
over, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Nor Ghai smiled also, and led her two
friends away. The last we ever saw of them were
their pretty forms toddling up the passage with
their pretty faces turned over their shoulders to
smile upon us. Then the tapestry hid them and
they were gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE POOL OF THE DEVIL-FISH.</span></h2>
<p>That evening, being unable to sleep, we sat up
late, packing our booty into the chests furnished
by the eunuch. They were light and strong and
so closely did the gems pack that we were able to
get our ivories and some other valuable ornaments
into an extra case. Before we went to bed
all the boxes were tightly nailed, wound with
cords, and the cords sealed with wax. As the
seals bore the impression of Prince Kai&rsquo;s signet
ring I felt sure they would be respected.</p>
<p>Next morning we sent for Wi-to, and when he
appeared, looking still a bit &ldquo;groggy,&rdquo; as Archie
expressed it, we told him the story we had
invented to suit our necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mai Lo is dead,&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>The Chief Eunuch started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have killed him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I would have said had I not seen it,&rdquo; I
answered, gravely. &ldquo;And perhaps, after all, the
governor did not intend to fulfil his duty so
hastily. Sit down, Wi-to, and listen to the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down, but looked incredulous and
uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you were ill yesterday,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;we
went out to take a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the governor&rsquo;s soldiers guarding every
door?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you yourself have said there were secret
passages that the governor did not know of. You
must not forget, sir, that we are the trusted
friends and emissaries of Prince Kai Lun Pu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may or may not have satisfied him. Anyhow,
he said nothing but looked at me inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wandered through the grounds, trying
not to meet anyone,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;until we came
to the great pool by the rocks which your people
say is inhabited by the devil-fish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Wi-to. &ldquo;I, myself, have seen
the monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much relieved to hear this, for it made
my invention seem more plausible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we stood looking into the pool,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;the governor suddenly stepped from the grove
of trees nearby and advanced toward us. He
held a naked scimitar in his hand, such as his soldiers
use, and he seemed very angry. He reproached
us for making the acquaintance of his
wife and daughter and for opposing his soldiers,
and declared we should not escape him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This struck the eunuch as quite reasonable.
He began to look interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were angry, and argued with him,&rdquo; I went
on, &ldquo;and while we were quarreling Mai Lo suddenly
gave a loud cry. We looked around and
saw the great ape called Fo-Chu, the King, leaping
toward us from the grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused and Wi-to said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He escaped from the pagoda several days ago,
and could not be found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were all frightened,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the beast
seemed fierce and excited. The governor alone
was armed, and as Fo-Chu bounded forward Mai
Lo thrust out the scimitar, and ran it through the
ape&rsquo;s body. But Fo-Chu drew the blade from his
own breast, swung it in the air, and with one
blow severed the governor&rsquo;s head from his shoulders.
Then the ape seized the body and leaped
into the pool with it, and both sank quickly beneath
the black waters. I am quite sure the beast
was dying at the time, and perhaps the devil-fish
grabbed them, for neither one came to the surface
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I finished the yarn the Chief Eunuch
coughed and looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But although the bodies were gone,&rdquo; I added,
&ldquo;the head of Mai Lo remained upon the ground
where it had fallen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; announced Archie, &ldquo;we used to
call him old Death&rsquo;s-Head, and may be it is appropriate,&rdquo;
and holding the horrible thing in his
hand, he advanced and laid it at the eunuch&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Wi-to grew pale and stared into the placid face
of his enemy. Mai Lo stared back at him, and I
could not see that the beady eyes or parchment
face had changed at all in death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the eunuch, turning away. &ldquo;It is
certain the man is dead. But who will believe
your story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, to begin with,&rdquo; said I, confidently,
&ldquo;and you will make others believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I brought some rice-paper, brush and ink from
the cabinet, where there was a store of such material,
and laid them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write the words I shall give you, in Chinese,
as Mai Lo would have written them,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The eunuch smiled as if suddenly enlightened,
and accepted the task cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wishing to die, as it is my duty to do,&rsquo;&rdquo; I
dictated, &ldquo;&lsquo;I have loosed the Sacred Ape and
trusted myself to his avenging hand. If I am
dead after we have met, all the world will know
that Mai Lo, Governor of Kwang-Kai-Nong and
the trusted servant of Prince Kai Lun Pu, who
lies with his ancestors, has done his full duty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wi-to nodded like an automaton and wrote with
much skill upon the paper, beginning at one of
the bottom corners of the sheet and working up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>The Chinese characters were neat and uniform,
and when the document was finished Wi-to laid
down the brush with a sigh of content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not used your words,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I
have used the idea. And the signature,&rdquo; he added,
with a sly leer, &ldquo;is the signature of Mai Lo himself.
I will now go and exhibit the head and
the paper, and salute Mai-Tchin as the new
governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So eager was he that he caught up the head by
its queue and dragged the grinning trophy away
with him without having it wrapped into a neat
parcel, as I had intended should be done.</p>
<p>Wi-to might not believe our story, but he was
assuredly glad to be rid of his long-standing foe,
and we had given the wily eunuch the clew that
would enable him to deceive anyone who might be
interested in knowing how the governor met his
death.</p>
<p>I have beside me, as I write, a clipping from the
Hong-Kong Gazette announcing the death of the
Governor of the Province of Kwang-Kai-Nong.
It states that he committed suicide according to
Shinto requirements, owing to the premature
death of his master, Prince Kai Lun Pu, late
Viceroy of the Imperial Chinese Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">321</div>
<p>Within an hour we left our rooms and ventured
to walk out into the palace and wander in the
grounds again. The soldiers had all been withdrawn
and the palace eunuchs made humble
obeisance to us as we passed.</p>
<p>There was no excitement apparent around the
palace. The artisans were busy with their tasks
and the gardeners pruned and weeded as deliberately
as ever. But when we descended the mound
we heard a loud chorus of moans proceeding from
the governor&rsquo;s house, and knew that his death
was now publicly recognized.</p>
<p>The place was getting decidedly distasteful to
us, and that evening we told Wi-to that we had
performed all the requests of Prince Kai and
wanted to return to Shanghai at once. He replied
that he was sorry to have us go, but appreciated
the fact that the unpleasant incidents of our visit
must outweigh with us the pleasure we had had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>Next morning we were waited upon by the
new governor, who received us in the state apartment
of the palace. We found him a weak, undecided
young man, who seemed frightfully nervous
at his sudden accession to power and eager to get
rid of us. We explained to him the terms of our
contract with his father, Mai Lo, and while we
did not mention the ten thousand taels, we insisted
upon a proper escort to Ichang and payment
of all the expenses of the trip back to Shanghai.
He agreed to every demand with alacrity, and I
could see he was in positive terror of the &ldquo;foreign
devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within forty-eight hours the arrangements
were all completed and the train of elephants,
horses and attendants gathered in the open space
before the palace. The eunuchs carried down our
heavy cases and loaded them upon the elephants,
and while the bearers must have thought them
tremendously heavy they dared not complain, and
the Chief Eunuch&rsquo;s suspicions were in no way
aroused.</p>
<p>Wi-to seemed really grieved to lose his guests,
and we thanked him cordially for his hospitality
and parted from him, both he and we expressing
the utmost good will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>Our escort was led by a very polite fellow, who
spoke amusing pigeon-English and had evidently
been instructed by Mai Tchin to show us especial
deference and obey our slightest command.</p>
<p>The result was that we met with little annoyance
from the natives along the route, and reached
Ichang with our entire treasure intact, after a
very agreeable journey.</p>
<p>There we left our elephants and horses and
boarded the steamer for Shanghai, taking with us
merely an escort of a dozen soldiers. These
richly dressed warriors commanded sufficient
respect to insure our safety on the trip.</p>
<p>At Shanghai Uncle Naboth was waiting for
us, and the dear old fellow was overjoyed at our
safe return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any treasure?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>We pointed to the sealed packing-cases which
the porters were laboriously unloading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough there, Uncle,&rdquo; I whispered,
&ldquo;to make us all rich as Rockefeller&mdash;if we can get
it safe aboard the <i>Seagull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll hire a special steamer to transport
it to Woosung,&rdquo; he declared; and knowing Mr.
Perkins as we did we were all relieved when the
treasure had been turned over to his care.</p>
<p>We met Dr. Gaylord in Shanghai, and he was
still &ldquo;out of a job.&rdquo; He seemed amazed that we
had returned safely from our adventure and
asked us a thousand questions which we answered
discreetly, without telling him too much. But he
was a good-hearted old fellow, and had been of
much service to us before his courage had failed
him and led him to desert our cause. Remembering
this, I placed a small packet in his hands
when we parted at the wharf and asked him not
to open it until after we had gone.</p>
<p>I hope it helped the good doctor to buy that
farm in England which he so much desired; for
although the packet merely contained what
Archie described as &ldquo;some of the loose plunder
that was in our pockets,&rdquo; it ought to have been
sufficient to set the doctor up for life.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are no customs officials at
the port of Woosung, and our chartered steamer
puffed directly to the side of the <i>Seagull</i> and
loaded us and our treasure on our own craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<p>We received a joyful welcome from my father
and the officers and crew, you may be sure, and
before we had told all of our story we were well
out at sea and were homeward bound.</p>
<p>I have often wondered if our visits to the
Ancestral Halls of the House of Kai have ever
been discovered, or the treasure we abstracted at
the instance of the Prince ever missed.</p>
<p>But from the far-away Province of Kwang-Kai-Nong
to the deck of the wandering <i>Seagull</i>
is a far cry, and it is unlikely we shall ever know
what happened in Kai-Nong after our departure.</p>
<p>Since that time we &ldquo;Boy Fortune Hunters&rdquo;
have been through many other experiences, not
all rewarded with equal profit, but, I can assure
you, quite as thrilling; and some of these I purpose
to relate at another time. Some of our
earlier adventures, such as those with which we
entertained the dying Prince Kai, may be read in
&ldquo;The Boy Fortune Hunters in Alaska,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Boy Fortune Hunters in Panama,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Boy Fortune Hunters in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
